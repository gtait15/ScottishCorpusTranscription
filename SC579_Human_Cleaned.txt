 ok
 well tell me about if you can your first day at school not got a clue do you not remember that
 no you must remember something were you dressed up in uniform i don't have that many memories from kind of before i was maybe 8 or 9 i mean there's certain things that will stick out
 but certain things that you look back on
 and see as being significant like your first day at school aren't significant at the time really that if you've kind of been through nursery it's just more
 yeah going off
 and seeing a lot of the same people you'd seen at nursery in a different uniform pretty much
 so i genuinely have
 no idea about my first day at school kind of earliest memory or earliest couple of memories would have to be the first 1 is from when i was 2 being in front of the tv
 and seeing the thriller video by michael jackson i mean i've always kind of been quite musical
 so f- for something that was
 so musically intense
 and had all the elements kind of the dancing going on as
 well that was kind of staggering for a two-year old
 yeah i mean even now it in my opinion it it leads the way in music videos
 and is the best music video of all time
 and kind of par- partially due to the elements of the dark side as it were kind of for a two-year old that's fairly exciting
 so that that's certainly 1 of them
 and the other is just kind of a general picture of being in nursery that i can't really put faces to the picture i guess
 but i just have e- elements of knowing that i can remember being there
 and i can remember the fact that there was a pair of twins can't remember who they were at all
 but i know they were there
 and there was a slide
 and things like that
 yeah it's all kind of fairly ha- or there's certain aspects of it where where it is fairly clear the picture
 but then other bits which just kind of blur into the background
 yeah inevitably it's kind of a photograph where you've focused in on 1 point
 and all the others get fuzzed out a bit
 yeah i remember whacking my thumb with a hammer at nursery doh it was really sore
 but i don't remember much else somebody had the same dress as me
 and that's about it
 and 1 thing i remember from was either primary 1 or primary 2 because both of them were down at the same wee school was getting stung on the eye or kind of on the on the eye- on the eyelid a bee by either a bee or a wasp uhuh which was a touch frightening i'm sure getting get carted off down to the doctor's which was quite close
 and phew ice pack
 and that was pretty much it not what you want as a 6 or 7 year-old also there was really tight corner that was just
 so inevitable that kids cause it was in the playground kids are just going to go running into each other as 2 kids go running from either side
 and its a blind corner kind of splodge straight into each other
 and they never did anything about it like put up a mirror
 so you could actually see if somebody was coming did you splodge into loads of people i don't think i did i think i generally took a more leisurely stood on the sidelines
 and laughed at them could see it happening way off
 yeah that's pretty much all i can remember from first 6 or 7 years of my life there must be things objects that stick out though i don't know like certain types of sweets that you had or toys not really
 no
 no i mean i think i'm aware of some some things that have been mentioned as stories
 but i have
 no true recollection of them in the same way that or it's very much a third party a third person memory that it's 1 that's like a christmas present i can remember or supposedly remember kind of th- magic teapot or something i remember what 1 was like
 but i don't remember mine even
 yeah though it's a standard thing it's kind of
 yeah
 but i've heard all the stories about me getting it
 and all that
 but i convince yourself that you might remember
 yeah i simply don't really remember mhm something like that i can don't know why mhm do you remember caroline
 and kenneth when you were wee not until i was kind of older maybe i wa- maybe i was adopted
 but
 yeah all the memories start kind of from later on which is i don't know why most people have more memories from very early on
 but i don't know if they do i think a lot of it is invented
 yeah maybe it is more superimposed whereas i've had kind of or i'll tend to think about these things
 and have realised that a lot of them are superimposed
 and
 so can scrub them from my memory
 yeah clear up the hard-disk space pretty much kind of far more useful stuff to be learnt
 yeah hmm i can barely even remember when i was in primary 3 when i was up at the big school as it was i mean a few memories like my last day at the school cause i then went off to fee-paying school
 and i remember me handing out smarties to everyone kind of the smartie bar kid
 and also remember kind of finding school
 so easy that it kind of frustrated me quite a lot that we were still doing basic reading kind of biff chip
 and kipper with kind of f- don't know that 1 4 words per page
 and it was basically far too easy
 and i cou- i was already reading kind of novels
 and stuff
 so i do remember e- even then i didn't have to work to do
 well which i think set me off for a bad has that always been the case then
 yeah
 and i think i think that did set me up for going wrong on the basis that up until i was 16 i never had to work to be top of the class or thereabout
 so if you've never had to do it then you get out of the way of it or never got into it full stop
 so then when highers come along
 and you should do some work never quite got round to it oops 1 can say oops
 but
 yeah at the end of the day i think they're overrated that here's kenneth with 3 degrees it depends what you want to do afterwards you wouldn't get
 yeah into academia without the degree
 yeah indeed
 but they handy s- kind of the qualifications are a means to an end
 but i think a lot of ends don't need the means that are deemed needed that for the job i'm doing some places were asking for a degree
 but why i kind of i don't think there is a need for a degree
 but it's just because
 so many people have a degree it then becomes a thing that's needed the stuff i do in my job i don't need anything learnt from about primary 5 onwards kind of basic adding multiplying subtracting dividing a bit of english able to communicate
 yeah other than that it's just to prove you can learn
 but what does proving i can learn to speak french prove to my ability to fix a computer cos
 but it's 1 of these things that society has deemed necessary
 and therefore nobody really goes against the grain don't you think its valuable though to have a wide range of of subjects at school to to cover a wide range of things
 so you can see what you do like or did you did you always know what you wanted to do computer i i didn't line i only found out in about senior 2
 and that was
 well may- to an extent primary 7 because we got got our first contact with computers then
 and it was a bit of kind of games just to get you into kind of the old pong
 and stuff like that
 and i was interested then i think largely because because kenneth
 and caroline were both older than me
 and kenneth in particular who would be more likely to play games with me he was by that stage 17 or 18
 and not really up for playing games with me as much kind of doing his sixth year studies as he was in when i was in primary 7 he was kind of working hard
 so it was basically i didn't have anyone to play with unless i was in school or actually went to the bother of going out
 and seeing my mates
 so something like a computer game where you can play against some sort of intelligence was way better
 and i think that was kind of 1 of the things that got me into it
 and then next thing i'm aware of the computers was probably second year when we used them in technology
 and i think i think i might even have gone in break or something
 and it was just kind of hanging about with other people who were using them
 and i started using things like paint
 and just mucking about
 and then found then we got 1 ourselves
 and i found i could use it better than a- other people which was through
 no real reason i didn't try harder
 but it was just something that i followed computers logic
 and i think
 yeah i think you either do or you don't i don't think it's something you really learn you can try hard
 but i think i will naturally be better than anybody who isn't a natural regardless of how how hard they try
 and that's not particularly being arrogant i would say although it might come across as being arrogant
 but i think i think it's just i do believe in kind of nature dictating over nurture there's still a combination of both
 but nature will always be strongest i won't ever be the world's strongest man hmm that's true cause i'm a bit of a skinny git
 but you know i just kind of computers come naturally
 and whereas dad would try for ages to do something
 and be all proud kind of i'd do it in a couple of minutes
 and not really think much of it
 but who knows ok can we go right back to your very earliest memories to the michael jackson video do you think that do you think that prompted your interest subsequent interest in music or do you think that that sort of confirmed i think it confirmed because according to dad anyway even when i was kind of still in cot when he was playing music i would bounce about in time to the point that he's never seen anybody else move in the same way at that kind of age to to radio or to the piano or anything or both
 yeah which i think again shows nature over nurture
 yeah because there is
 no way that is a taught response at that age because kenneth
 and caroline both had the same kind of music going on in the background
 yeah
 and didn't react in quite the same way i mean
 yeah th- they are both musical
 but i think
 yeah music has played a far more important aspect in my life
 and it's i do get lost in music in a way that i don't think kenneth or caroline do i think i think kenneth might i'm not sure i don't know i think i think kenneth kind of could do with a map when he's go- listening to music
 but i'm truly kind of god knows where i am
 and to the point that somebody can walk past me who i know
 and i just won't realise
 and that has happened before
 and they've been saying hello to me
 and ive just walked straight past them which is rather embarrassing when you see them the next day
 oh
 yeah
 so i think it has played an important part
 and it was around before i saw it
 but that's what interested me in the video was it was something that was very intelligently done it was it's a great tune
 and it's pretty much faultless everything about it is
 so
 well produced
 and fits in together it is seamless at what point did you start to
 well i'm presuming you're not suggesting that at 2 you were able to discriminate
 and realise that that was what was at what point did you start to
 well have preferences i suppose i think i probably had preferences even then that i'm assuming that i'd seen other music on the tv
 and hadn't reacted in the same way that hadn't made such an impact i mean obviously kind of the classical stuff i was being played by record by dad playing was coming across
 and i was reacting positively to that
 but the other kind of the more pop side element of it i hadn't reacted or i'm not aware of reacting to maybe i was
 but i'm not aware of it
 but then this came on
 and even as a two-year-old it blew me away i don't know why cause i don't think as a two-year-old i was able to determine a well-produced f-f- film not consciously
 but there must there must be something almost subconscious about it
 and i'm worried about saying subconscious because i don't know how much of a subconscious a two-year-old has i don't know either
 but i don't know how much of a conscious a two-year-old has either
 so i think it's hard to work out what was going on in my mind particularly as it's such a like one-off memory that
 yeah
 yeah that i can look back
 and see that i was seeing the video
 but i can't look back
 and see what i was thinking about the video in a way
 so i can't kind of analyse what was in my mind at the time i was just remembering wow here's this music video that for some reason has me engrossed who knows who knows
 yeah
 so
 well the michael jackson may have been your first influence what what sort of i've obviously heard stories about the tapes that you all chose in the car what kind of path did your musical interest take from there i mean for certainly a good few years it was mainly classically-based because kind of the stuff dad was playing dad was the 1 who could afford music
 and had a system to play it on
 yeah
 and i didn't do you think that's been the influence
 oh absolutely without doubt even now a positive influence i mean rather than something to
 oh
 yeah
 oh
 yeah avoid
 no i'm hmm still into classical music much to the surprise of a lot of people hmm
 but i didn't buy my first album till about ninety-two ninety-three when i would have been 11 or 12
 and that was the best rock album in the world ever
 and i think by that stage my influence was being was mainly led by kenneth because he was very much into the rock side whereas dad
 and caroline
 and mum weren't
 so i think he was definitely where i got a lot of the music of my teen years from i particularly liked the heavy stuff cause i was annoyed with life
 so i kind of it very much fits in
 and is a typical teenage music the kind of heavy metal uhuh
 and i think that's why these bands even going back to the sex pistols who were kind of very agressive
 and even before then the rolling stones etcetera who were breaking new ground they- by
 no means that loud or agressive by todays standards
 but for the time they were they were kind of that generation's voice hmm
 and it's kind of changed slightly over the years it went to the sex pistols then kind of heavy metal
 and now rap to an extent
 so kind of these were or kind of heavy metal was a large influence because i was angry
 and it kind of fits in
 and when you're feeling pissed off with the world
 and you've got other people who are feeling pissed off with the world you feel there's other people there with you is it the lyrics or is it the music both i mean all kind of a lot of the lyrics are kind of pretty much we're going to change the world
 and make it good
 yeah
 and it's it's an interesting thing that you get particularly in the eighties you ha-
 and in america you had all these associations like mothers against metal or whatever who were strongly against heavy metal for its anti-christian viewpoints
 and then you look at the lyrics of the songs
 and like anthrax had 1 world which is basically saying don't care where you come from just get along
 and you're thinking hang on that's an utterly christian view
 and yet these christians are going out for blood against bands like these that's the stereotype though isn't it wh- who wh- who kind of has the christian view the christian or the 1 singing the metal
 and they probably both have a lot of ignorance though
 well kind of i think it's a bastardised christian view that christian views should be love everyone
 but by going after them they're losing their christian view which i think's a touch ironic really
 and i think they didn't endear themselves by going after them they just made them seem more the victim which more appeals to the rebellious teenager
 so they're going to go for them even more
 so i think that was a singularly bad idea by the mothers against metal
 and all all of the various associations
 and organisations intention was any good i think the intention was vaguely honourable
 but they just didn't think that
 yes they want everything to be good
 but they don't think about what good is or public choice general freedom etcetera it's kind of moving towards a big brother society
 yeah which depends on your viewpoint on that
 but i'm certainly with orwell in thinking that it wasn't particularly good
 but
 so kind of i did have the metal influences
 but i didn't pick up all of kenneth's influences cause he was also into his jazz which i've never picked up on
 but i think what i took from the metal was the need for playing very technically difficult pieces which also had in common with classical music skill jazz is technical
 but i always felt with a lot or certainly the classical music that i liked
 and the heavy metal that the music was going somewhere it's it's it's a hard phrase to understand cause
 well where's the music going
 but it's just something i feel jazz is kind of it's lots of notes fairly quick quite often
 but it doesn't really matter is maybe it's a mood it is it is a mood
 but i've also seen too many live jazz musicians who kind of try
 and feel or kind of look
 oh we're
 so harshly done by
 and you know they're going back to their kind of nice six-hundred 1000 pound house with all all that's good
 and i think that's something that's affecting metal that when metal started out the bands that were there had
 no money they were down-and-out they were playing to survive
 so kind of their agression claims against society held merit
 and i think that's why they've fallen down now that a lot of the bands who've got really big lose that edge because
 well
 yes i'm just off back to my 5 million penthouse kind of
 well why are you pissed off with society really any more you're doing quite
 well
 so i think that's kind of lost it
 and that's to an extent why 1 of the reasons why i've not been that keen on jazz because i feel it lacks emotion that blues is very different that it's less technically orientated
 but there's a lot of feeling in it mainly or kind of certainly in its origins it was deep south where the black men only had the blues that was their life
 yeah when they weren't slaves
 and they were very poor
 and they were playing for feeling
 and sometimes the more successful ones to make a living
 and if they didn't they didn't have anything else
 so there is feeling in there
 but i just feel that jazz lacks feeling
 but going back to the kind of classical metal you kind of both of them are very technically orientated
 and certainly what i found when i went off to university was that a lot of the metal bands borrowed heavily from classical music which i found very interesting that particularly kind of the first artist that really got me into that was yngwie malmsteen who you'd be listening to a song
 and then it would just go into bach or paganini
 and sound really good
 and i think that's kind of that aspect has definitely had a profound impact on my choice of music that i have now kind of separated away from what kenneth likes that my likes are pretty much classical things rocked up or rocky things that are very heavily classically-inspired
 so kind of even over the past 6 months the lead female vocals which is very much more an operatic thing as opposed you get some pop bands that have female vocals
 but they they've never really crossed over into metal as much
 but they do with the cl- kind of classically-inspired metal with violins
 and all kind of classical instruments going on in the background
 and i think that's it merges my 2 main music interests together not with a popular thing
 but i like it
 so fair enough i know your other
 well 1 other passion perhaps is the motorbike
 yeah does that fit into the whole rock
 and classical kind of ideal it kind of stereotypically probably fits into the heavy metal aspect perfectly
 but it's not related to that at all i kind of haven't been a bike-nut
 and still amn't
 but it was kind of i use- i used to cycle a lot
 and then i was kind of thinking
 oh i suppose i should really do with learning to be able to get myself over distances of more than about 6 miles i was i don't i don't like criticism
 and i felt if i'm in a car i'm going to get criticised a lot
 so kind of being on a motorbike i'm by myself nobody's going to criticise me hmm
 so its passengers
 and people in the car that would criticise rather than fellow drivers
 yeah
 so kind of you're not a fan of fellow drivers though are you i would say most drivers are fairly pish
 but hey they're safe because they don't break the speed limit
 well some of them
 but that's a whole nother story do you feel safer on a motorbike than on an ordinary bike
 yes because you've got the power to get out of obviously if you crash there's a lot more that can go wrong on the basis that if you're doing 90
 and you come off it's gon na be a whole lot worse than doing 20
 and coming off though i've got more safety equipment on when i'm on the motorbike
 but it's crashing hasn't really come into my mind it
 well kind of mum always kind of worries
 but
 yeah i'm much more what will be will be if i'm gon na crash i'm gon na crash it kind of life's full of turns
 and it's only i normal that she should worry about it more than you shes
 yeah not in control of it you are
 yeah bu- you know the amount of control you have
 yeah
 but i think kind of by the nature of or certainly going by other people likelihood is in my life of riding motorbikes i will have a crash simply
 well everyone i know who's had a motorbike other than 1 who's only got 1 a week ago has crashed their bike
 so logic would dictate that in all likelihood i would at some point come off my bike which is a bit of a pants-wetting situation
 but i kind of i don't spend any time worrying about it it's not kind of it doesn't play on my mind at all
