 f718 ok
 well tell me about if you can your first day at school m734 not got a clue f718 do you not remember that m734
 no f718 you must remember something were you dressed up in uniform m734
 i don't have that many memories from kind of before
 i was maybe 8 or 9
 i mean there's certain things that
 will stick out
 but certain things that you look back on
 and see as being significant like your first day at school aren't significant at the time really f718 m734 that if you've kind of been through nursery it's just more f718
 yeah m734 going off
 and seeing a lot of the same people you'd seen at nursery f718 in a different uniform m734 pretty much
 so
 i genuinely have
 no idea about my first day at school kind of earliest memory or earliest couple of memories would have to be the first 1 is from when
 i was 2 being in front of the tv f718 m734
 and seeing the thriller video by michael jackson f718 m734
 i mean
 i've always kind of been quite musical
 so for something that was
 so musically intense
 and had all the elements kind of the dancing going on as
 well that was kind of staggering for a two-year old f718
 yeah m734
 i mean even now it in my opinion it it leads the way in music videos
 and is the best music video of all time
 and kind of partially due to the elements of the dark side as it were kind of for a two-year old that's fairly exciting f718 m734
 so that that's certainly 1 of them
 and the other is just kind of a general picture of being in nursery that
 i can't really put faces to the picture
 i guess
 but
 i just have elements of knowing that
 i can remember being there f718 m734
 and
 i can remember the fact that there was a pair of twins can't remember
 who they were at all
 but
 i know they were there
 and there was a slide
 and things like that f718
 yeah m734 it's all kind of fairly or there's certain aspects of it where where it is fairly clear the picture
 but then other bits
 which just kind of blur into the background f718
 yeah m734 f718 inevitably m734 it's kind of a photograph where you've focused in on 1 point
 and all the others get f718 m734 fuzzed out a bit f718
 yeah
 i remember whacking my thumb with a hammer at nursery m734 doh f718 it was really sore
 but
 i don't remember much else m734 f718 somebody had the same dress as me
 and that's about it m734
 and 1 thing
 i remember from was either primary 1 or primary 2 because both of them were down at the same wee school was getting f718 m734 stung on the eye f718 m734 or kind of on the on the eye- f718 m734 on the eyelid f718 a bee m734 by either a bee or a wasp f718 uhuh m734
 which was a touch frightening f718
 i'm sure m734 getting get carted off down to the doctor's
 which was quite f718 m734 close f718 m734
 and phew ice pack
 and that was pretty much it not
 what you want as a 6 or 7 year-old also there was really tight corner f718 m734 that was just
 so inevitable that kids cause it was in the playground kids are just going to go running into each other f718 m734 as 2 kids go running from either side
 and its f718 m734 a blind corner kind of splodge straight into each other f718 m734
 and they never
 did anything about it like put up a mirror
 so you could actually see if somebody was coming f718 m734 f718 m734 f718
 did you splodge into loads of people m734
 i don't think
 i
 did
 i think
 i generally took a more leisurely f718 stood on the sidelines
 and laughed at them m734 could see it happening way off f718 m734
 yeah that's pretty much all
 i can remember from first 6 or 7 years of my life f718 m734 f718 there must be things objects that stick out though
 i don't know like certain types of sweets that you had or toys m734 not really f718
 no m734
 no
 i mean
 i think
 i'm aware of some some things f718 m734 that have been mentioned as stories
 but
 i have f718 m734
 no true recollection of them f718 m734 in the same way that or it's very much a third party a third person memory that it's 1 that's like a christmas present
 i can remember or supposedly remember kind of th- magic teapot or something f718 m734
 i remember
 what 1 was like
 but
 i don't remember mine even f718
 yeah m734 though it's a standard thing it's kind of f718
 yeah m734
 but
 i've heard all the stories about me getting it
 and all that
 but
 i f718 convince yourself that you might remember m734
 yeah
 i simply don't really remember f718 mhm m734 something like that
 i can don't know why mhm f718 do you remember caroline
 and kenneth when you were wee m734 not until
 i was kind of older f718 m734 maybe
 i wa- maybe
 i was adopted f718 m734
 but
 yeah all the memories start kind of from later on
 which is
 i don't know why most people have more memories from very early on
 but f718
 i don't know if they do
 i think a lot of it is invented m734
 yeah maybe it is more superimposed f718 m734 whereas
 i've had kind of or
 i'll tend to think about these things
 and have realised that a lot of them are superimposed
 and
 so can scrub them from my memory f718
 yeah m734 f718 clear up the hard-disk space m734 pretty much f718 m734 kind of far more useful stuff f718 m734 to be learnt f718
 yeah m734 hmm
 i can barely even remember when
 i was in primary 3 when
 i was up at the big school as it f718 m734 was
 i mean a few memories like my last day at the school cause
 i then went off to fee-paying school
 and
 i remember me handing out smarties to everyone f718 m734 kind of the smartie bar kid f718 m734
 and also remember kind of finding school
 so easy that it kind of frustrated me quite a lot f718 m734 that we were still doing basic reading kind of f718 m734 biff chip
 and kipper with kind of f718 don't know that 1 m734 4 words per page f718 m734
 and it was basically far too easy
 and
 i was already reading kind of novels
 and stuff
 so
 i do remember even then
 i
 didn't have to work f718 m734 to do
 well
 which
 i think set me off for a bad f718 has that always been the case then m734
 yeah
 and
 i think
 i think that
 did set me up for going wrong on the basis that f718 m734 up until
 i was 16
 i never had to work to be top of the class or thereabout
 so if you've never had to do it then you get out of the way of it or never got into it full stop f718 m734
 so then when highers come along
 and you should do some work never quite got round to it f718 oops m734 1 can say oops
 but f718
 yeah m734 at the end of the day
 i think they're overrated f718 m734 that here's kenneth with 3 degrees f718 it depends
 what you want to do afterwards you wouldn't get m734
 yeah f718 into academia without the degree m734
 yeah indeed
 but they f718 handy m734 kind of the qualifications are a means to an end f718 m734
 but
 i think a lot of ends don't need the means that are deemed needed f718 m734 that for the job
 i'm doing f718 m734 some places were asking for a degree
 but why
 i f718 m734 kind of
 i don't think there is a need for a degree
 but it's just because f718 m734
 so many people have a degree it then becomes a thing that's needed the stuff
 i do f718 m734 in my job
 i don't need anything learnt from about primary 5 onwards kind of basic f718 m734 adding multiplying subtracting dividing f718 m734 a bit of english able to communicate f718
 yeah m734 other than that f718 m734 it's just to prove you can learn
 but
 what
 does proving
 i can learn to speak french f718 m734 prove to my ability to fix a computer f718 m734 cos f718 m734
 but it's 1 of these things that society has deemed necessary
 and therefore f718 m734 nobody really goes against the grain f718 don't you think its valuable though to have a wide range of of subjects at school to to cover a wide range of things
 so you can see
 what you do like or
 did you
 did you always know
 what you wanted to do computer m734
 i
 i didn't f718 line m734
 i only found out in about senior 2
 and that was
 well may- to an extent primary 7 because we got got our first contact with computers then f718 m734
 and it was a bit of kind of games just to get you into kind of the old pong
 and stuff like that
 and
 i was interested then
 i think largely because because kenneth
 and caroline were both older than me
 and kenneth in particular
 who would be more likely to play games with me f718 m734 he was by that stage 17 or 18 f718 m734
 and not really up for playing games with me as much f718 m734 kind of doing his sixth year studies as he was in when
 i was in primary 7 he was kind of working hard
 so f718 m734 it was basically
 i
 didn't have anyone to play with unless
 i was in school or actually went to the bother of going out
 and seeing my mates f718 m734
 so something like a computer game where you can play against some sort of intelligence was way better
 and
 i think that was kind of 1 of the things that got me into it
 and then
