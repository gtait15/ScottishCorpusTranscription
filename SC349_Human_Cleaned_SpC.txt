 f631
 so
 i'm going to take you away back f634 f631 can you think about
 what your earliest memory is f634
 yes f631 f634
 yes my earliest memory would be
 i was born in 19 44
 so my earliest memory would probably be about 19 47 or 8 when
 i was 4 year old
 and
 i had gone to the ponds to get some fish
 and
 i had a jam jar with some string round it
 and
 i had a fishing net
 and
 i had about 15 little minnows in the water
 and
 i was really really happy
 so
 i brought it back
 and
 i was climbing up the stairs to go into the house to show off my catch
 and the a girl
 who lived above me
 who sadly was down's syndrome
 and
 and was a wee bit aggressive came up the stairs grabbed the jar swung it as hard as she could smashed it against the wall
 and all the fish were in a big puddle on the steps squirming about
 and the just the noise of the glass crashing f631 f634
 and then all these little minnows squirming in the pond was just too much for me
 and
 i evidently ran off you know yellin my head off
 and
 i don't know
 what happened to her
 but then you know she she couldn't really help it she was just f631 f634 she wasn't she wasn't right sheila her name was
 and that's that's 1 of my earliest memories f631 f634 of that was in f631 was that when you lived in cragie street f634 cragie street in the tenement a room
 and a kitchen 5 of us in that house
 well there was 6
 but then my dad died 5 of us in that house my mum 2 brothers
 and a sister
 and myself
 and
 i was the youngest
 and the toilet was on the stair there was
 no electricity until just before we left that we had gas gas lamps
 and we left cragie street in
 well
 i was 7
 so that would have been 19 51 we left cragie street in just it was just before that that they got electric lighting in these houses the outside was lit by gas lamp you know the outside lights f631 f634 in the street
 and on the stairs the man the lamp-lighter came at night
 and put the lights on
 and came in the morning
 and put them off f631 f634 there was an actual lamp-lighter
 and he came with a great big long pole that he would cause the the gas lamps were really high up to keep them away from the kids
 so he came up with a great big long pole
 and
 i
 i don't know how he
 did it
 but he just seemed to stick the pole into the glass
 and the light either went on or it went off f631 f634
 i've never yet discovered f631 f634
 what that pole was all about f631
 yeah f634
 but that was
 what he
 did
 so it was a it was a a colourful place to live f631 f634 in many ways
 and f631 how old were you were you how old were you when your dad died f634
 i was just comin up for 2 when my dad died he had some some injuries in the war
 and when he came home from the war he was most unwell
 and he developed tuberculosis
 and there was
 no cure for tuberculosis in these days
 so he was put into hospital
 and when it became clear that he was goin to die my mum took him out of the hospital we were all sent out of the house because it was
 so contagious tuberculosis f631 f634
 so we were put away from the house you know ferried out to different people to look after us
 and my mum looked after him
 and then he died
 and the 5 of us stayed on in the house until as
 i say 19 51
 and then we were sent out to
 what to me was the country
 and was a bungalow
 and the council had started to decant people from the central centre of the city out to the housing schemes f631 f634
 which virtually were built in the country certainly for us townies we were surrounded by fields in the housing estate that we were sent to f631 is that the prefab f634
 so
 no f631
 no f634 that was in fintry f631 right
 yeah f634 in fintry
 and there was 3 bedrooms there was a bath
 which was a huge luxury there was a bath
 and a toilet
 and of course the biggest luxury was that it was indoors you know we
 didn't have to go out to the toilet
 and we had a proper kitchen
 and a living-room
 and a front
 and back door
 and a garden
 and that was incredible for for
 i mean
 i only had a short experience of my life in a tenement
 but for people
 who were born
 and bred
 and brought up in tenements all their lives to move out to a council house in the country with all these facilities was just amazing
 but 1 of the problems with that was the council were not very long-sighted because they put people out there
 but there was
 no infrastructure built the roads weren't completed
 so there was
 no transport could come out there there was
 no shops
 so it meant that people had to walk into town now it wasn't that far it wasn't that far
 but it
 did mean a hike into town for shopping then they started through time to have some vans come out you know a baker van would come out
 and a butcher van
 and a fish van
 but of course they were expensive because they you know they had their overheads for their vehicles
 so most people trekked into the town
 and then gradually gradually shops were built as the schemes developed
 and got bigger cause we were in the first street that was ever built in fintry it was called fintry gardens
 and that was the first street of this
 what is now a huge housing estate
 but when the as
 i say when the first street was built there was there was there was
 no
 i mean there was actually
 no the road wasn't built the houses were built f631 f634
 and they were complete
 but there was
 no road you know
 so it was a kind of a muddy track up to the houses sounds incredible because it's all laid out now
 and everything's you know ever- you know all the roads are complete
 and there's a huge infrastructure now there's schools
 and shops
 and you know clinics
 and all those kind of thing there now
 but there wasn't in these days
 but anyway nevertheless
 i thought
 i had died
 and gone to heaven because it was just f631 f634 incredible in fact
 i kept runnin evidently
 i don't remember this
 but evidently
 i kept runnin through the house it was such a novelty to go in 1 door run through the house
 and out the other door it was a huge a huge novelty
 and then like every other novelty it just became you know it just wore off
 and it was just your house
 and that was fine
 but f631
 and
 did you go f634
 yeah f631 were you at school age f634
 yeah
 well there's another story wi that my my mum
 i had gone to the school glebelands
 which was near to cragie street
 and
 so when
 i moved out to the housing scheme my mother
 i think the next day my mother took me to the window
 and pointed to the wee school that was in the field a few fields away there was a wee school in the field
 and she said to me see that that building there
 and
 i said
 yeah she said that's the school you're going to tomorrow
 and of course
 i
 did my usual you know
 i don't wan na go to that school because you know
 i've got all my my friends are at glebelands
 i don't wan na go there oh
 well you've
 no choice that's where you're going
 and the next day she took me down to the corner of the street
 and 2 girls 1 was called ruth gold
 and 1 was called dorothy wright
 i remember them
 so clearly
 and she said to them you goin down to that school
 and they said
 yes
 and said
 well take her with you that's true now they would be maybe a year older than me you know they were f631 f634 bigger than me
 but they took me to the school
 and they took me in to the headmaster
 and said this is the new girl she's starting here today
 so he said you know
 what's your name gave him my name
 and he said go along to room 4
 and
 i just had to walk along the corridor
 and go into room 4
 and the teacher there said just come in she'd looked at the register she was obviously expecting me looked at the register
 and said just sit down there
 and my my worry was that on the blackboard they were doin joined-up writing joined-up writing
 and f631 f634
 and she said to to the class now
 i want you to copy this passage into your jotter
 and she handed me a split new jotter
 and a split new pencil
 and
 and
 i said
 oh
 i'm sorry
 but
 i don't do that kind of writing f631 f634
 and she said
 well you do now that's the kind of writing we do here
 so having gone from just you know
 i don't know
 what you call the not-join- the un-joined-up writing f631 scripture f634 to the to the joined-up writing was
 what
 i it shifted from that in a matter of a morning f631 f634
 and
 and then came home
 and was showin off that
 i could now write in in big people's writing f631 f634 you know big people that was the way big people wrote
 so that was my that was my jotter
 and
 i was very pleased with that
 i was worried to begin with
 but you know
 i was very pleased with that
 and
 i loved that school
 i actually loved that school it was called linlathen primary
 and 1 of my teachers ah was a lady called eleanor leith that we of course called miss leith f631 f634
 and
 but she told us her name was eleanor
 and she
 i was a bit of a mischief
 but she seemed to like me
 and 1 day
 i would
 i had a sore tooth
 and because
 i mean we
 didn't have a dentist or anything god
 i don't think
 i had a toothbrush in these days never mind a dentist
 but anyway she said
 what's wrong with you because
 i'd maybe been mumpin
 and sulkin cause
 i was in pain with this tooth
 and
 i told her
 i had a sore tooth
 and she says
 well get your mummy to take you to the dentist
 and
 and
 i said
 oh
 well my mum
 doesn't have time to do that you see because you know
 i mean we don't know where the dentist is
 and all this nonsense
 so she said
 well
 i tell you
 what she said
 i'll take you to a dentist
 and at 4 o'clock
 i got to sit in her car that was a huge excitement
 i got to sit in her car
 and she took me to this dentist down in stobswell we went in we went up the stairs it was up a stair we went up the stair it was a bit scary because
 i'd never been in a dentist
 and all the instruments were there
 and everything
 but the great thing was on his on the radio
 which was in his the surgery bit he had scottish music playing
 and all the time the music was playing he was singing along to it you know
 i mean it was amazing f631 f634
 and he sat me in the chair
 and gave me a swirl round let us swirl around a wee bit he knew
 i was frightened
 and miss leith just popped her head in
 and then popped her head out again
 and he
 did whatever he
 did to the tooth
 i don't know whether he
 i don't even know whether he pulled it out or whether he filled it that
 i can't remember
 but he he looked after the the tooth anyway
 and he he gave me a little a little round tin of toothpaste
 and a tiny little brush he just gave it to me to take home
 and he said f631 f634 cause he said do you do you brush your teeth often
 and
 i said
 no f631
 did you not have a tooth- brush f634
 i didn't have a toothbrush or toothpaste
 so he gave me the toothpaste
 and the toothbrush
 and he said now when you go home you need to brush your teeth in the morning before you go to school
 and at night before you go to bed
 and he said you have very good teeth
 but you want to keep them keep them good do you eat many sweeties
 and
 i said
 no because we
 didn't we
 didn't get sweeties f631 f634
 but for some reason 1 of my tooth had gone a bit my teeth had gone a bit bad
 so that was that
 and it was the next day at school when when miss leith ran me back f631 f634 to to where
 i lived by that time now we were in a prefab
 and
 so she ran me back to my to the house or or to the street where
 i lived anyway
 and
 i jumped out the car
 and she said to me
 did you notice the name on the dentist's
 did you notice the name on the plaque outside
 and
 i said
 no
 i never even noticed the plaque never mind the name
 and she said
 well the name says gordon s leith dental surgeon
 and gordon s leith is my father
 and
 i says your father's a dentist
 and she said
 yes she said
 so now
 i went to that dentist for years after that f631 f634 you know went every 6 months or whatever it was you know for your check-ups
 and
 and kept up you know with the dentist for many many years after that until
 i went to mr butt you know that f631
 yeah f634 that you've that you went to f631 that's the first dentist
 i can remember f634 mr leith died cause
 i mean he was a good he was a good age when you know he was quite elderly f631 f634 when
 i went with that night with miss leith
 so he was a good age
 and he died
 and then
 i
 didn't have a dentist for a wee while
 and then
 i started going to mr butt
 and then he was the life-long dentist after that looked after you folk's teeth as
 well f631 f634
 but
 yeah
