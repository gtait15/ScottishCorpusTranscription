 so can you think about what your earliest memory is hmm
 yes
 yes my earliest memory would was born in 1944
 so my earliest memory would probably be about 1940 or when i was 4 year old
 and i had gone to the ponds to get some fish
 and i had a jam jar with some string around it
 and i had a fishing net
 and i had about 15 little minnows in the water
 and it was really really happy
 so i brought it back
 and i was climbing up the stairs to go into the house to show off my catch
 and the a girl who lived above me who sadly was down syndrome
 and
 and was a wee bit aggrieved came up the stairs grabbed the jar swung it as hard as she could smashed it against the wall
 and all the fish were in a big puddle on the steps squirming about
 and the just the noise of the glass crashing
 and then all these little minnows squirming in the pond was just too much for me
 and i evidently rang off you know yelling my head off
 and i don't know what happened to her
 but then you know she she couldn't do the help
 but she was just she wasn't she wasn't right sheila name was
 and that's that's 1 of my earliest memories of that was in craigie st in the tenement a room in a kitchen 5 of us in that house mother was 6
 but then my dad died 5 of us in that house my mum 2 brothers
 and a sister
 and myself
 and i was the youngest
 and the toilet was on the stair there was
 no electricity until just before we left that we had gas gas
 and we left craigie st in when i was 7
 so that would be 1951 we left craigie st
 and just it was just before that that they got electric lighting in these houses the outside was lit by gas lamp you know the outside lights in the street
 and on the stairs the man the lamplighter came at night
 and put the lights on
 and came in the morning
 and put them off there was an actual lamp lighter
 and he came with a great big long pole that he would because the gas lamps were really high up to keep them away from the kids
 so he came up with a great big long pole
 and i don't know how he did it
 but he just seemed to stick the pole into the glass
 and the light either went on or it went off i've never yet discovered what that poem was all about
 but that was what he did
 so it was a it was a wonderful place to live in many ways
 and i haven't very how old were you when your dad died i was just coming up for 2 when my dad died he had some some injuries in the war
 and when he came home from the war he was most unwell
 and he developed tuberculosis
 and there was
 no cure for tuberculosis in these days
 so he was put into hospital
 and when it became clear that he was going to die my mum took him out of the hospital we were all sent out of the house because it was
 so contagious tuberculosis
 so we were put away from the house you know ferried out to different people to look after us
 and my mum looked after him
 and then he died
 and the 5 of us stayed on in the house until as i say 1951
 and then we were sent out to what to me was the country
 and was a
 and the council had started to decant people from the central centre of the city out to the housing schemes which virtually were built in the country
 and certainly for us townies we were surrounded by fields in the housing estate that we were sent to
 so
 no that was in fintry in fintry
 and there was 3 bedrooms there was a bath which was a huge luxury there was a bath
 and the toilet
 and of course the biggest luxury was that it was indoors you know we didn't have to go out to the toilet
 and we had a proper kitchen
 and a living room
 and a front
 and back door
 and a garden
 and that was an incredible for for me
 and i only had a short experience of my life in a a tenement
 but for people who were born
 and bred
 and brought up in tenements all their lives about to a council house in the country with all these facilities was just amazing
 but 1 of the problems with that was the council were not very long sighted because they put people out there
 but there was
 no infrastructure built the roads weren't completed
 so there was
 no transport could come out here there was
 no shops
 so it meant that people had to walk into town now it wasn't that far it wasn't that far
 but it did mean a hike into town for shopping then the started through time to have some vans come out you know a baker van would come out
 and a butcher van
 and a fish van
 but of course they were expensive because they you know they had their overheads for their vehicles
 so most people trekked into the town
 and then gradually gradually shops were built as the schemes developed
 and got bigger because we were in the 1st that was ever built in finchley it's called finchy gardens
 and that was the 1st st of this what is now a huge housing estate
 but when the same in the 1st st was built there was there was
 no there's
 no i mean there was actually
 no the road wasn't built the houses were built
 and they were complete
 but there was
 no rd you know
 so it was a kind of a muddy track up to the house it sounds incredible because it's all laid out now
 and everything's you know everything you know all the roads are complete
 and there's a huge infrastructure now there's schools
 and shops you know clinics
 and all this kind of thing there now
 but there wasn't in these days
 but anyway nevertheless i thought i had died
 and gone to heaven because was just incredible in fact i kept running evidently i don't remember this
 but evidently i kept running through the house it was such a novelty to go in 1 door run through the house
 and out the other door it was a huge a huge novelty
 and then like every other novelty it just became you know i just wore it off
 and it was just your house
 and that was fine
 but were you at school
 yeah
 well there's another story with that my my mum i had gone to the school grouplands which was near to craigie street
 and
 so when i moved out to the housing scheme my mother i think the next day my mother took me to the window
 and pointed to the wee school field a few fields away there was a wee school in the field
 and she said to me see that that building there
 and i suggest she's that's the school you're going to tomorrow
 and of course i did my usual you know i don't want to go to that school because you know i've got all my friends are at cleveland's i don't want to go there
 oh
 well you've
 no choice that's where you're going
 and the next day she took me down to the corner of the street
 and 2 girls 1 was called ruth gold
 and 1 was called dorothy wright
 and i remember them
 so clearly
 and she said to them you going down to that school
 and they said
 yes
 and said
 well take her with you that's true now there would be maybe a year older than me you know they're bigger than me
 but they took me to the school
 and they took me into the headmaster
 and said this is a new girl she's starting here today
 so he said you know what's your name give him a name
 and he said go along to room
 and i just had to walk along the corridor
 and go into room 4
 and the teacher there said just come in she looked at the register she was obviously expecting me looked at the register
 and said just sit down there
 and my worry was that on the blackboard they were doing joined up writing joint operate
 and she said to the class now i want you to copy this passage into your daughter
 and you handed me a split new daughter
 and a split new pencil
 and
 and i said i'm sorry
 but i don't do that kind of writing
 and she said
 well you do now that's the kind of writing we do here
 so having gone from just you know i don't know what you call the not join the unjoined writing to the to the joined up writing was i'm it shifted from that in a in a matter of a morning
 and there
 and then came home
 and was showing off that i could now write in in big people's writing you know big people that is the way big people wrote
 so that was my that was my jordan i was very pleased with that i was worried to begin with
 but
 yeah i was very pleased with that
 and i loved that school i actually loved that school it's called lynn lathan primary
 and 1 of my teachers i was a lady called eleanor leith that we of course called miss leith
 and she told us her name was eleanor
 and she i was a bit of a mischief
 but she seemed to like me
 and 1 day i would i had a sore tooth
 and because we didn't have a dentist or anything god i don't have a toothbrush in these days i mean with a dentist
 but anyway she said what's wrong with you cause i'd maybe been mumping
 and sulking because i was in pain with this tooth
 and i told her told her how to sore tooth
 and she says
 well get your mummy to take you to the dentist
 and
 and i said
 well my mum doesn't have time to do that you see because you know i mean we don't know where the dentist is
 and all this nonsense
 so she said
 well i'll tell you what she said i'll take you to a dentist
 and at i got to sit in her car that was a huge excitement i got to sit in her car
 and she took me to this dentist down in strobeswell we went in we went up the stairs it was up a stair went up the stairs it was a bit scary
 but scary because i'd never been in a dentist
 and all the instruments for the head
 and everything
 but the great thing was on his on the radio which was in his the surgery bit he had scottish music playing
 and all the time the music was playing he was singing along to it you know i mean it was amazing
 and he sat me in the chair
 and give me a swirl around let it swirl around me
 but he knew i was frightened
 and miss leith just popped her head in
 and then popped her head out again
 and he did whatever he did to the tooth i don't know whether he i don't even know whether he pulled it out or whether he filled it that i can't remember
 but he looked after the tooth anyway
 and he gave me a little a little round tin of toothpaste
 and a tiny little brush he just gave it to me to take home
 and he said cause he said you you brush your teeth often
 and i said
 no i didn't have a toothbrush or toothpaste
 so he gave me the toothpaste
 and the toothbrush
 and he said now when you go home you need to brush your teeth teeth in the morning before we go to school
 and at night before you go to bed
 and he said you have very good teeth
 but you want to keep them you keep them good you eat many sweeties
 and i said
 no because we didn't we didn't get sweeties
 but for some reason 1 of the tooth had gone a bit
 but my teeth had gone a bit bad
 so that was that
 and it was the next day at school
 and miss leith ran me back to wear i lived by that time now we were in a prefab
 and
 so she rang me back to my to the house or or to the street where i lived anyway
 and i jumped out the car
 and she said to me did you notice the name on the dentist's did you notice the name on the plaque outside
 and i said
 no
 and i've even noticed the black never mind the name
 and she said
 well the name says gordon s leith a dental surgeon
 and gordon s leith is my father
 and i says your father's a dentist
 and she said
 yes she said
 so now i went to that dentist for years after that you know went every 6 months or whatever it was you know for your checkup
 and
 and kept up you know with the dentist for many many years after that until i went to mr you know that you that you've that you went to
 yes mr leith died because he was even he was a good age when you know he was quite elderly when i went with that night with miss lees
 so he was a good agent he died
 and then i didn't have a dentist for a wee while
 and then i started going to mr
 and then he was the lifelong dentist after that looked after you folks teeth as
 well
 but
 yeah i loved that school it was a great school it's a
 yeah
 yeah she was a really really nice person miss leith
 and she was really she used to give us all a christmas present everybody got the whole class got a christmas present now it was just a small thing you know maybe a penny dainty or something like that
 but the great that you got called out the your desk you've got cut out of your seat to come
 and get it you felt
 so important you know
 and she always kept me to last i was always last because i i was alphabetically i was last
 but nobody behind me alphabetically because i was t for tate
 and
 and i was always last
 and that anticipation because it was always in a little brown a little brown paper bag
 so you didn't know what what you were going to get
 and everybody got something a wee bit different
 and
 oh anticipation of that was amazing
 and then you would go out
 and you'd see something like
 well i hope you have a very nice christmas
 and we'll take care on the roads
 and then we'll see you after the after the holiday you know she always said that every year we'll had her for 2-3 years i think
 so she she sticks in my memory as far as teachers are concerned because she was
 so kind
 and she was really kind as
 well to all the naughty ones you know how you know including myself you had these naughty people
 and she was the 1 as
 well when she'd said i was misbehaving 1 day
 and she said to me get i can't remember didn't know she's here outside
 no
 yeah she said out
 and i didn't mean i didn't know whether she meant out the class or out the school out of dundee or out of everything
 so i thought
 well if you stand outside the door
 and the headmaster comes along you get into trouble because he knows you've been put out for being naughty i felt the only thing to do is go home
 and i went right over school
 and the thing was i knew that that if i got home once i got home there would be nobody in i would be stuck because my mum was working all of us at school my brother was home on leave from the army
 but i wasn't very sure about that whether he would be home anyway it was a winter's day a dark day
 and when i came up to near the prefab i could see the light on in the bathroom
 so i'm i knew he was in
 so i went in
 and he said to me why are you home you should be at school
 and
 and i first of all said i was
 and i wasn't feeling
 well i was feeling sick
 so that's first of all i thought i'd try that tack to me this is neil
 and he said to me don't look sick
 and i saw him do the godly sore tummy
 and eventually it came out that i'd been put out because i was wanting to ask him whether she meant out forever or just out
 so he said
 well if you've been naughty i think you've probably been told to get out out of the classroom not out of
 and certainly not out of education the education system
 so you said now you don't know what you have to do
 and i said
 no he says
 well you have to go right back after lunchtime
 and you have to stand at our desk when the school bell rings you line up then you go to her you get into school get into the classroom go to our desk
 and say miss leith i'm really sorry for misbehaving this morning
 and i won't do it again
 and
 and i said
 well
 no see i can't do that because everybody will laugh
 and he says
 well that's why you have to do it that's why you've got to say you're really sorry
 and you won't do it again
 and i was going back down the road saying i'm not doing that i'm not doing that i'm just going to sit in the classroom
 and i'm not saying anything i'm just going to go in go to my desk
 and sit down
 and i went into the classroom
 and i don't know why i did this i don't know why i did it to this day
 but i sort of sidled up to the day
 and she was trying not to look at me she could see me at the corner of her eyeb she was trying not to look at me eventually she turned round
 and she said
 yes
 and i said what neil said for me to say with great difficulty
 but i said it
 and she just said 1 word
 so i just done from the desk
 and sat at dinner was happy because i thought i'm back in again you know i wasn't quite sure how things were going to go if i was out forever you know how was it going to learn things or or when could i play in the playground if i wasn't the school you know
 so i was happy to be back in that school system again quite
 no need for that kind of thing
 so burnt you because there was the time at nursery as
 well that you just sort of might be wrong until it's
 well i was actually evolved from school because you see i was brought up in the nursery
 and i was in the nursery when i was months old because my mum had to go to work
 and there was all these council nurseries where babies were taken in because it was just after the war
 and you know things were very very different
 and anyway i was brought up in ellen gown nursery every day i went there
 and i was virtually just taken home at night
 and put to bed
 so the nursery was my home the nursery was my was really like my home
 and when i went to school i i went to school the first day went you know was taken in registered
 and everything
 and at play time when we came out to play i just walked out the school
 and walked back to the nursery which was within walking distance of the school i just went right back to the nursery because i thought
 well it's time to go home now fun enough
 and then it evidently appeared at a window that very low windows in this nursery school the windows were deliberately low you know the the windows actually came down quite low
 so that the nurses could see out if the children were playing out
 but i had looked in the window of the matron of the the nursery school
 and she was sitting at her desk writing
 and she looked up
 and she said evidently she said to my mum all she could see was this he had a blonde curls looking in the in the window
 and thinking
 oh god she's back she's going
 oh god we've got her back
 so she she beckoned to me to come in
 so now went into her room she said to me what are you doing here
 and i said
 well i just came back because i've been to school now
 and it was ok
 but that's it
 and she said
 no you don't come back here audie you have to stay at school you're at school now you don't come to nursery school
 and she phoned the school said you'll have to send her sister along for an all of was in a few primaries above me you'll have to send her sister for her
 so all have came for me dragging on road because she was fed up she'd been taken out of a class that she was really enjoying maybe art or something
 and she had to come
 and collect me
 so she took me back now after that i think i was the start of unlocking gates
 and things in schools because then i lock the gate i just walked out of the gate
 and i never actually did go back to the nursery school
 but i was really sad you know because it it really was my my life the nursery school it was my home for for all these years
 and the nurses were like moms really you know the nurses that the nurses we're all because you were taken there like my mum started in the mills at she would probably start at half 7
 so i'd be taking it at the back of 7 just after
 and then i wouldn't be picked up until half 5 at night
 and then of course you know my mum would be tired
 so we'd be taken home
 and bathed or or maybe not even bathed just taken home
 and put to bed really
 so that's why it was important that the nursery that's why the nurses school is
 so important to me
 and what was your doing machine also working the mills
 yeah
 yeah you see there was nobody to look after you because everybody you know my mum's sisters
 and brothers what all in the mill
 and the all the the all the a different job
 and my my mum was a spoolwinder which just is exactly what it says she wound the flax on the
 and there was a that 1 of my other aunts was a weaver
 and there was a finisher
 and there was a a flattener
 and there was a a sparker
 and
 oh there was all the different trades of the jew industry
 and they all worked in different parts of it you know my mum said at 1 stage there was a member of the family in every every sector of the mill right at the beginning
 and then because the flax goes through different processes you know it arrives off the ships from pac or arrived off the ships from pakistan
 and then it went through various processes
 and my mum reckoned that at 1 stage you know the family had all grown up
 and at 1 stage there was 1 of them in each in each area the mill siblings did while she was the oldest of 13 chad chad chad 12 brothers
 and sisters there was 6 girls
 and 7 boys 6 girls
 and 7 boys twins joseph
 and james they died in infancy they were about 4 months old evidently when they died
 but that was common long ago sadly because that was before inoculations
 and that's when things were people with that size of a family certainly couldn't afford to nourish them all you know they weren't wouldn't be all
 well nourished wouldn't have
 and they lived a very hard life in a very very house in the centre of the town near the docks
 and my mum being the oldest had all the work had a lot of work to do you know besides her besides her job she had a lot of work to do in the house with the children
 and it doesn't sound like a great life at all that wasn't a good life my mum's dad
 yeah he was called joseph
 and he was he was a bit of a dead loser as my mum would put it because he drank very heavily
 and he worked he worked on the docks he worked he was a play what they call a plater
 and that was a skill that that was to do with shipbuilding plating was to do with you know putting the outside pieces on the on the actual ship
 and
 so that's when my grandfather did
 but very often he was never at his work because he couldn't lift his head off the pillow if he was really drunk
 but magrani used to be able to go down
 and get his wages
 yeah she would go to the docs
 and they knew what my grandfather was like
 and they knew that she had this huge family
 and she used to get his way she just picked up his wages he didn't touch his wages
 and
 but said he always got money somewhere for drinks she's never never yet really knew where he got it from
 but he always managed to get money for a drink
 so she had a very hard life extremely hard life
 and yet she was very tough very resilient which was in her 80s
 and she was still helping you know washing nappies for her various you know grandchildren
 and
 so she was really a bit of a character
 yes
 yes she couldn't get round your name kenneth she couldn't you mean cared as that was you should never heard of it of course
 but then it sounded really like a boy
 so she couldn't have couldn't have cope with that at all
 but
 yeah i think they had a really really hard time
 and when my mum was expecting me this just gives you an idea of the culture of the time when my mum was expecting me mahar her mum who's my gran had gone to the pictures had gone to see a film
 and they were sitting in the pictures
 and my mom you know that her due date was a few weeks away
 so
 but she started to feel really uncomfortable in the pictures
 and she said to my grandma i'm not really not feeling too good
 so my gran said
 oh
 well she listened to her saying that for me while
 and eventually she said
 oh come on walk up the road
 so they started to walk up the road
 and walking up the road was becoming more
 and more uncomfortable for my mum it wasn't that far
 but it was up a hill
 and she was
 and she really was uncomfortable anyway they got up to the circle round about where my granny lived because we were going back to my
 and her my mum's brothers several of my mum's brothers were hanging about on the corner as they did in these days
 so my granny says you better go down for the midwife
 and my mumma definitely said i don't think i'm needing a midwife she's i think i've still got a bit to go yet
 but i'm really
 and my granny to thomas go
 and get the midwife
 so thomas took t seals
 and ran down through mccreagy to find the midwife by which time now i we had got where my mum
 and my gran had got home
 and my mum my gran said to my mama you better go through
 and lie down because she had been looking a bit white
 and poorly
 so she went through to lie down
 and i came into the world
 and my gran said the midwife arrived
 and my gran had just said too late you know she was babies born
 so my grand virtually brought me
 so that was you know that was that
 and evidently mcgran had brought quite a few people you know a few of the neighbours that had gone into to labour too quick you know the midwives didn't get there in time my grand thought nothing of it had 13 of her own she knew when she would be delivered some of them she knew fine what to do
 and
 and
 and
 so on
 so i mean it was quite nice because she used to tell me years later
 and that you know she had brought me into the world
 and fortunately it was quite an easy birth you know there was
 no complication i'm sure if there's complications then you'll have to get into hospital
 but most babies in these days were born at home
 and you only went to hospital to have your baby these days if there was a complication most infants were born at home
 so my granny certainly brought me into the world
 and common in was it coming for men to be around these days
 no
 oh
 no
 oh
 no i wasn't coming for meant to be around when you were born kennis some men did it some men chose to do it
 but it wasn't common
 and i think a lot of it don't even think it was much the men didn't want to be there the hospital didn't want them there it was they've changed you see that's all changed now with the hospital
 and i think it's changed for the better the hospital recognises that mums want the dad there want their husbands there in some cases
 but in in certainly in my mums day
 oh my god my my my dad
 well certainly my dad was at sea you know he was in the navy
 and he was away with the war
 but i would have doubted if he would have been there
 and none of them the boys were allowed in the room you know none of the brothers are or certainly my brothers were allowed into the room
 yeah it was very very different in these days
 but i think i think my mum may the time i came along had probably just had enough babies you know should have brought up practically brought up all her own siblings
 and then she had 4 of her own
 so i think she'd just
 well had enough by that time
 and that's right that's right
 so i mean it was hard it was hard for her there's
 no doubt about it
 but
 yeah it just seems it seems that long ago
 but in yet in some ways it's a million light years from from nowadays you know how things have changed
 and
 and some things have definitely changed for the better
 but i still think some things were were better in our day in that you know we could we could play in the street there's
 no cars i mean cars never came along our street cars i wasn't i was it wasn't in a car until i was about 7 because
 and only reason i was in a car was because i was a flower girl at our next door neighbour's wedding
 and oliver
 and i got to sit in a in a car
 and we thought that was amazing
 and i i got gloves that was another amazing thing i got that i mean i didn't worry i was like you when you were little kids you never like dresses
 and things neither did i
 and the only way i would wear the dress was i had gloves i got to wear these gloves i remember my mum saying i mean it's ridiculous you know she doesn't like wearing a dress
 but she's happy to wear the gloves
 so for some reason we had these little white you know wrist gloves
 and i thought it was i was really something in these gloves
 and
 yeah do you think it's much safer than for children or do you think it's just that we hear more about what goes on i think it was generally safer
 and yet i was taken away from the street
 but we won't go into that
 but i think it was generally safer
 and the reason for that is that an awful lot of the neighbours hung around the street there was more there was more community spirit i think then
 and that might be just because even if the layout of the houses i don't know
 but there seemed to in our street there was a 2 shops on the end of the street you know there was a green grocer
 and a grocer like a fruit shop
 and
 and a grocery store
 so
 and the the the ladies of the street certainly the elderly ladies of the street used to sit on the short window sills
 and you know share their snuff boxes
 and chatter away of an evening you know they were all there was always somebody in the street
 so of course when kids were playing you know the fell over or they were unwell or they were fighting something these elderly ladies were unwittingly babysitters you know cause they'd say hey stop that or you know they would they would get involved in some frack of of of anything was happening
 and i think that culture has gone i think that culture has gone because people are
 well i don't i think i think it might have just been the layout of the buildings
 and everything i'm not sure
 and the fact that it was there was
 no traffic came along the street
 and there was
 no buses you see in these days it was tram cars
 and the tram cars came down the main street because of the cable line
 so the street really was a playground the street was the playground
 and we had to park we had baxter park
 but then you couldn't go up to baxter park unless somebody took you there you know because it was a fairway step for us
 but the boys you know my brothers they they played in the street they played football in the street
 and there was air rage there was air raid shelters around the back in our close you know for for for the war
 and of course they weren't taken down even after the war finished
 so the best thing in the world was to climb on the top of them
 and there would be maybe 910 feet high you know they weren't that high
 but high when you're wee
 and of course you weren't allowed on them there was a big rule
 and kids weren't allowed on the top like to go in them
 but they weren't allowed to go on the top of them
 and they were all manner of ways sort of wooden ladders
 and things
 and we we sort of piles of stones that that would be erected to get you up neighbour all hidden round from the from the windows hidden round the back
 so that your mum if she looked out she couldn't see climbing onto the shed
 and you never climbed on a shelter of course that was within sight of your own window everybody went to another shelter
 and there was 1 day that oliver
 and i were you know they'd got me up onto the shabbos only about 3 seemingly
 and they'd got me up on to this shelter
 and i mean we were just we just we were
 so mischievous
 and being
 so dare devilish you know on the top of the shelter
 and i can remember actually being a bit wimpy
 and thinking
 oh you know it seems
 so up here
 oh
 and then the next thing was the policeman came through the big bend
 and all because he was the top of his helmet
 and all of his destiny lie flat on your face
 and don't say a word
 so i'm spread eagled on the top of this shelter
 and little did we know that this guy could just stand on the pile of stones that we got up on
 and then we could see his whole head looking across
 and all he did was a great big man
 and all he did was put over these massive hand pluck me off of this shelter
 and you know lift me down
 but drop me a bit of foot from the bombs
 so that i didn't get down with too much ease
 and then he licked his pencil shift through his notebook to get to the right page
 and then he said name
 so of course your name meant in the policeman's book
 and the id now was the policeman going to to your door
 and tell your mum you'd been on the shelters
 so all of when i decided we were actually going to have to run away we could not go home because the punishment would fit the crime
 and the crime was bad
 and the punishment would be worse
 so we thought
 well we'll just make a run for it
 so we went out the clothes
 and we got along to the end of the street
 and all have just kept saying to me just keep following me just keep following me
 and then we looked up the street
 and all of we can see this my grand coming down albert st bustling a denture she always came down
 so she was on a mission she came down
 and she shouts to all of come here
 so of course you seem to do this you see
 so all of goes up what are you doing what are you doing on the end of the street your 1 is supposed to on the end of the street is you're also supposed to be in the middle of the street
 so all i've said we're just looking for somebody she's
 well get
 and that means get meant get home
 so which is done tail
 and went back
 and we were sort of sat outside for a while thinking
 well has he been yet has he been to the door yet or or will he go after because we thought
 well we need to go we need to get some tea some tea some tea sometimes
 so we're unsure whether we should go
 and have the tea
 and then get the or or we should not go
 but i'm not i mean i'm i've got this story in my head
 and i'm not just sure what happened
 but certainly we never got into trouble
 so i don't think the guy ever went near the door i don't think the policeman did
 but on saying that we never went on the shelter again because we've just got such a fright that if my mum like if a policeman went to your door i mean that was the end of the world you know can you remember russians number had ration books right up until we didn't have ration books in fintry
 so we'd imagine i think 1948 or 4849 would be the end of the rationing i think
 and that's why with never any sweeties because you did get coupons for sweeties
 but you could swap them for coupons for an egg this kind of thing
 and of course my main sweeties were were for rich children you know
 so we never ever got sweeties i can remember getting an easter egg when i was quite big when i say that maybe 8 or 9 from uncle john
 but all of a 9 easter egg
 and i mean you just thought all your birthdays have come together
 and easter egg to yourself
 and warren woolworths
 and the woman went to put mine in a bag you know put it in a bag
 and i didn't want it in a bag as i had to show it off i wanted everybody in the world to see this easter egg i knew they show off that it was mine
 and of course my mum confiscated the easter egg as soon as we got home the easter egg was put into the cupboard
 and we were only allowed a tiny little bit every day
 and she was allowed a tiny little bit of our easter egg every day
 so with the result that easter egg lasted seemed to last for
 but we just we just didn't mean you couldn't steal it you know you couldn't mean with that did occur to us with hops we could go
 and steal a bit more
 but she knew she knew what stage that egg was
 so you could not steal it
 and
 and i reckon i've got a theory on this because i reckon that's why we all had good teeth you know we never had a blimming toothbrush
 but then we never had sweeties
 and we didn't have biscuits you know you didn't have a lot of sweet things didn't have really a lot of anything
 but you certainly didn't have a lot of sweet things
 but
 yeah i've got a lot of i've got a lot of happy memories i don't have memories sadly of like ever getting on my mum's knee or getting a story or i mean we didn't have any story books or i loved i loved going to the the little story story classes in the library there's a little story telling classes where you could primaries 1-2
 and 3 got allowed to go to the library
 and a lady would come
 and read a story to you
 and that was great i love that because this lady would make all the characters come to life you know she would speak like the character did now
 so that was really clever because because she became that character in the book you know
 but after you came out of primary 3 that was it you know you'd never got another story in your life that was the end the story
 so i i don't have memories of that kind of home life
 but i have i have happy memories of of situations
 and incidents at school
 and outside of home life you know i have that when did you start going skating cause that's the thing that hmm
 yeah skating i started to go when i was probably in secondary school 12
 yeah started going when i was 12 started to try
 and learn to skate that's a laugh because you know you spent more time on the on the ice than you did on your
 but
 but eventually you know after years of years of plodding on became quite a good skater certainly quite a good speed skater peter used to like to go up at the what they call the lady speed
 and you know the ladies would go
 and go around as fast as they could
 and then there was the men's speed then there was the dancing now i didn't i wasn't good enough for that
 but
 yeah they danced on ice
 yeah
 yeah maureen golden i remember maureen golden the first time i ever saw her ever saw her was on the ice
 and it was only after i met up with her years later i said to her i recognise you you used to be a nice skater a dance ice dance skater didn't you
 and she said
 yes beautiful costumes i remember she always had different costumes on
 and she was very very good ships security ice dance skater
 and i still have watching it at that time most people just went away
 and had a cup of tea or a drink of juice when the these intervals were on
 but i always stayed i was just like to watch the
 and a few couples would go
 and do the dancing together
 and it really it really was good
 but
 yeah light skating
 and what did you the skating
 well i got a pair who i thought i really really something i got a pair of wine burgundy corduroy trousers
 and a white polo neck jumper
 and that was a really trendy in these days that's really trendy
 and then i can't remember i had a skating skirt i had a skating skirt because girls war skating skirts in these days
 and i can remember just not liking it because i thought it was too long
 and i said to olive you know could you could you shorten that for me you know mrs can't do anything for herself said could you could you shorten that for me
 and
 so she starts to pin it up a bit you see
 and i'm not want it shorter than that want it shorter than that
 and she was saying you can't get it any shorter than now for goodness sake
 and i think it was neil neil
 and you know came in
 and all this nonsense
 and me singing that
 and
 and he said
 no you don't he said it's that's a good length away that is just now
 and he said always remember it's what people don't see that's more interesting not what they see
 and i've never forgotten that
 so anyway i got my skirt that the the decent length
 and that was that
 but we didn't wear skirts too long
 and then we'll or 2 you know it was mostly trousers it was mostly trousers because it was cold you know
 and if you went down with a skating skirt on you know you were you're soaking you know in a bit your trousers give you a wee bit more protection
 and it was great fun
 and loved this when i met my first boyfriend bill bill hadron as we'd have met him
 but he really fancied my friend he fancied my friend carol rains
 so it was really after things things just went sideways him
 and carol i had to wait in line
 and then after things went really sad with him
 and carl he started to skate around with me that was what you did you that meant the boys came
 and sort of skated alongside you
 and when i think back
 and he offered me a piece of his chewing gum that was quite serious that was it that was serious i thought he was probably the next question would be would be wanting to marry me that wasn't the next question the next question was how far do you live from the ice rink that was before he said ken
 and walk you home
 so you had to wait
 and see how far it was
 and was it in his direction now
 and fortunately it was kind of in his direction
 so bellini sort of skated around together went for wee walks you know maybe about 141314 at this time went for wee walks on a sunday around cape park
 and scintillating stuff
 and i like i liked he had a lovely little sister i remember there was there was bill
 and then there was this huge gap you know
 and then his mum had this unexpected be you know a little girl
 and she i i remember
 and i just thought she was gorgeous like we shirley temple only blonde
 and sometimes he used to come with her
 and we would take her to the park
 and
 and stuff like that
 and then we're just sort of drifted you know we just drifted away
 but certainly the skating that the first boyfriend was on the cards
 but
 yeah skating was really good fun
 and again it was dead safe because we used to come out the skating
 and walk all the way home you know along the kingsway all the way home
 and it was a long way that quite a long way
 but
 and i don't remember any trouble or anybody being attacked or assaulted or mugged or anything like that you know it was it seemed to be dead safe
 yeah it was good do you like the skating too didn't you
 yeah
 yeah
