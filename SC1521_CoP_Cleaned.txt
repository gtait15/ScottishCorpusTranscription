 and perhaps you could just start by introducing yourself in terms of how are you scottish or whatever
 and background
 and
 so on are either of you first
 well i've lived in scotland for since 1969 off
 and on born in england with a scottish mother
 and an english father
 and married to a scotsman who is just say lift your life 1st 26 years in rutherglen
 and since then hamilton
 and are you are your parents also are they also scottish
 yes i thought you were my mate just been born in england a bit from just a month or 2 old she was brought to glasgow
 so to consider yourself to be scottish you wasn't actually born here
 yes very grandparents would be english
 but micro chips what did they do
 well the grandfather died before my mother was born actually
 so right i think he was an alum to reminder here is what armature winder was it amateur winder somebody wings amateur motors right what's an amateur thank you it's coiled i'm part of the law firm electrical water electrical coil on a motor can be aware of the word didn't know then in those days women didn't work
 but my grandfather was my grandmother was widowed she opened a shop near celtic park silly in suite
 and such like
 so i'm told because all my all 4 of my grandparents were deceased before i was born i never knew anything
 so i do i'm an irish drama my my maternal grandmother was of irish stock i can't have to remember my name at the moment
 but it was there she came up from ireland
 so they came over to scotland from ireland
 yes there's quite a lot of irish in northern england i think liverpool
 and newcastle
 yeah
 well same as glasgow
 yeah
 no that was my maternal or not maternal as far as i know my dad's parents are both
 well
 and truly english mum's mum's from
 and he's still got relatives around the dundee area forward on the
 yeah
 well my father had strong dindi connections did he have any particular words that he used that weren't there were that's to pinned him down as dundee rather than the west coast anything that you remember was different
 but i remember because i don't really know what dundee wants to say that's what i do there just words
 well there there is can a lot to do that can they cancel that's up north that's
 no did you
 and the rest of the families that love didn't because she's been engaged a long time
 but i used to say ken
 but 1 thing when we're talking about this at the apple or anything recently which is a word i hadn't heard since childhood
 yeah my mother called it apple ringing
 but dad's dad called it what was it flecky now
 and yet he was from the dundee area
 no
 well it wasn't the family connection
 but clay bank he lived in all his life till he got married all right some background i'll give you to fill in the back story of this because obviously i i know what you're talking about
 but the rest of the right not have the ringing is what it's sutton wood or artemisia
 and the only time i'd ever heard this called apple ringing was as a child it was in the garden
 and it was always apple ringing it's very scented isn't it i was i just that's very self herbally smell
 and i always used to have this picture of kind of rings of apple with the the coal missing it's always brought up in the world sort of dryings of apple it was all that i thought about
 and then this flicky nail i think we looked at flicky i can't remember what it meant
 but we up because you weren't sure how it was spelled i don't know right i would spell flechie does the flecky part of the word mean anything particular
 yeah
 but i can't remember we'd have to look at the dictionary right probably we worked out kind of how it came to be called the only other kind of scottish word i can remember it sticks in my mind when i was young was the word sleekest because i didn't even know it was scottish until i used it in a it was an essay
 and it was i was writing about a character in something like bar chester towers who was called i think it was slope we had the name that suggested his character
 and i used the word sleekest
 and i got the essay back
 and it was a query beside it
 and luckily the the english teacher was scottish she was from glenrothes
 so he knew what it meant
 but i didn't
 well apparently not
 no he said
 but it's quite is it not quite common or
 well known as a scottish word
 no exactly
 yeah it's like it's right
 well how many people in england would know much about burns
 but if they knew anything that would be the line they'd know hmm it seemed apparently was a work i shouldn't be using english essay because it was just a scottish word stuck in the mind
 so when you move it up to scotland what did you notice any did it come as a shock did you the first thing that happened got off the train at queen st in january 1969 coming up from south that's where we got off from through up to edinburgh
 and then across right right
 and it was ranked
 and were all these strange people on the station who would what would to cause they were all dressed up
 and everything i'm trying to think i thought it january
 but it's think all these weird people
 and then before we came once we'd applied for jobs
 and got jobs
 and there was a story in the paper about a body found in a bin in glasgow which hand made us think twice about it
 yeah
 and then we met in 1971 at
 and remember that man
 oh the pink elephant the white elephant
 no wait quite a lot of it's sucking on street in glasgow
 yes
 oh i can't remember just several is it still there or is it still club in the same area it is there is still a club there i'm sure it was on the 1st floor of a building
 and we met there because we were both in new conservatives it was a young conservative discount isn't there a story that you you were there with a friend
 and the friend said you have the lanky 1
 yeah i want the other 1 you've taken the big enough i don't think you you take the big 1
 yeah that was golden
 and that was that was
 yes hotless
 yeah
 so it was a good partner
 oh
 yes even was when we went in 1970 what was after you had 1971 who went down to tunbridge wells
 and she met him down there in spending the question
 so was glasgow like in those days in the early 70s sixties early 70s
 well what was that what was that club or disco like what what sort of although it's 1 of these big blitter
 but that was that in the early 70s
 so they're they're
 yeah
 yeah
 and another place that was popular was the majestic for dancers known as the magic stick the magic stick
 and then there was the highlanders near charing cross which was that's the granny rightly if you got dancing there you got flung around the room does that sort of scottish country survival of saturday night dancing is that is that
 yeah
 yeah
 so that's fairly stunning you did in the the 1 in sochi or
 no that was
 so far you know
 so rock
 and soft
 and stuff
 yeah
 yeah
 and they all finished up at at night
 and you got bus home we didn't from there because gordon had a car gordon i'm sure he had a counsellor then
 yes ok
 oh that night
 well he used this models minivan photos wouldn't get into that into a minivan how many was there
 well i wouldn't have been sitting in the back with
 no sense there'd be 2
 well like a mini car there was a van a van version of it mini in the front all right right i see i thought you meant it was van
 but
 well it was a van just 2 windows at the front panels behind right
 but like a dull boy or cab 4 way than that it's like the mini it's the period of the mini car with more department stores in glasgow then big ones in saugehall st in copeland
 and lye pettigrew's
 and then there was another 1 it looks like she hi was up where the it's very old i see fair on ec right that was where the mcclellan galleries are now laser thread old
 and there was another 1 new heads or something further down on the same as that basically do 2 phrases phrases
 and lewis's that was the way of thinking in his this have made then there were less there were fewer sort of change jobs
 yeah
 yeah it all tended to be the big part which were excellent you could get anything especially copeland line remember these have a good sort of haberdashery department pictures
 and there was a lovely restaurant is ma browns it's called m
 and a browns the cake shop there's a restaurant downside downstairs for us
 yeah does that not be there has there not a cake still
 no that's bradford sir it's different i was further down because my brain sounds familiar
 well it was probably around while you were young it was the downstairs
 so you might have been there for high 1 night don't explain the concept of a high tea you don't think that's the universal
 well it's more scottish than english i'd say you don't really get half season england
 so you could do that 1 exactly
 yeah
 well there was a meal that you had around early evening consisting of often fish
 and chips
 and main course certainly fish
 and chips would feature stick pie gummon
 and pineapple bread
 and butter from 1 an air toast or bread
 and then they do coffee with capes choice of tea or coffee which came with a meal on a plate a teared
 yeah cake do you think
 yeah choice of
 well probably stories usually a scholarly or trumpets pancakes could you just i don't really remember this
 well i do remember the concept
 but i don't obviously wasn't paying for things when i was like 5
 so did you did you pay for what you had or did
 oh right
 yes that's right pay for the whole lot you could eat them all if you wanted
 oh
 well there we there was a limited amount put like if there at a table for 4 there before cakes out
 yeah right right you'd fight over there
 so
 and you can't
 well
 no you kind of eye up deciding which 1 you want to do i remember doing that pineapple cake eiffel tower planning cake
 yeah
 yeah remember down at air at the was it the county hotel in the square there
 and were there with peg
 and ted from america
 and you
 yeah
 and grandma was there as
 well
 and the kids came
 and i remember there were a couple of sort of good cream cakes
 and then kind of ordinary things i don't know
 yes i think how long was i remember that was called in belgium biscuits i don't know why
 but they were biscuits when she made them is that because is that because of her scottish roots or english thing or just a quick i don't know
 well probably not close empire biscuits up here
 but the world's belting biscuits around them
 yeah
 oh store these that's another thing store these that's very scottish a lot of my household was
 oh
 well that gets very dumb too
 so what did you in your household what meals do you remember from then you have days of days of the week things
 and those
 yes then it was
 no
 no will you i we had fish on a tuesday because fishing boats didn't go on a sunday night for religious reasons for fishermen being very superstitious
 so when i went out on a monday night back on a tuesday we get fresh fish every tuesday for right tea that night i fish fish is something that roman catholics have on a friday
 yeah why is that is it because they avoid meat
 yeah
 so prophecy prophecy households didn't happen
 yes that's right what's artificial
 so i don't know kotter had us is always a happy
 yeah
 no sometimes we better be lemon soul probably ok finished again we had a
 yes smoked
 and dyed it could have been
 so
 and then we would have hearing the mother would make potted heading in the summer months pairing from loch fyne that rule mops used to buy those in
 yes the fishmonger remember the fishmonger
 and fruit shop combined he used to get all mobsters mcfisher mac fisher is a cheese he used to get real mots in bhs
 and hamilton when they had a when they got i didn't like them
 but pat used to buy them
 oh
 yes probably
 well i don't think i had them
 but i didn't think i liked them his business in glasgow is still there called adding fees who are fishing fish merchants
 and their slogan vans was fresh from the sea to add a mcphee right there's 1 in bynes rd it's jack murphy though isn't it
 oh
 well it's probably the same family right because i was thinking they use that slogan i think they officially none of that was delivering to the shops
 so did you come back sorry did you come around the van the fish right
 so you describe the shopping
 but wasn't 1 deal with the remains of the sunday roast that was the monday deal
 yes bald ham knows bee chicken
 yeah stop on the monday who may consider all right
 but i don't trust
 and then rice pudding boiled baked rice ok it's an item like skin
 oh big time the skin on
 oh i love that brand not greatly do you like me not megna still not didn't think you had a problem with that mega i'll probably going to ignore it all together if it was there
 but did you know
 yeah specify nutmeg on my it was semolina semolina sometimes which i didn't like
 and it would be
 well my mother never made things like tapioca
 and seagull because she didn't like mother probably the texture of them shouldn't like
 and i've certainly never took to those myself here i heard something on radio just this morning
 and it brought back a memory
 and how many by jelly these days to make a jelly dessert
 yeah it's a jelly texture
 and you get you used to get i remember when i got used to make jelly pistols somebody's found the last tin of crimola form in the world shop
 yes really
 yeah why don't you stop making that actually stopped it's only when you were little or had up to the i'm sure he's great about 7 or 8 years ago probably we used to buy lemonade powder in walls she used to buy loose like by the quarter pound or something shove it in a bag for you which i suppose it was optional the form thing it
 and always lemonade
 yeah
 no i think it's going to museum isn't it i can't remember
 oh
 no somebody is buying it to try
 and track the ingredients
 so they could start making it again to underline although whether nestle or allow them to do that or not i don't know because it might still have the the rights to it
 well i could call it
 but
 yeah that's what's going to happen to it i don't think you'll have a copyright over
 no random list of ingredients
 well you could have applied to
 well cooked it was a criminal form 1 i say they have
 no they haven't everything to change
 but that's why they keep an ingredient secret presumably
 so that you can't copy it because
 so you know she can analyse all the ingredients in criminal form probably you could do it in coca-cola
 but it's not ok if indeed there is a secret ingredient sorry i was going to say you never said to school lunch yesterday or me
 no
 no never never once to have school lunch or something else went did you do know what sort of things people had at school lunches home for lunch
 so i heard stories of what
 and stew i don't know if it was health giving healthy or not
 well nothing like burgers they didn't exist in those days
 yeah
 but there's nothing
 well cabbage always smelt the whole school out when it was getting boiled up in the canteen it never smelled very satisfying the worst job was when you're on dinner duty when you have to clear the tables
 and have to go to the slot bin with everything i remember i dropped the plate in once tell anybody you discover it i was more deprived refer every individual with to take their own pick by ved
 no you had a sort of monitor system
 and you have sort of probably on for a week
 and you were the 1 who cleared the table or something or the 1 who brought the mashed potatoes or something brought to the table in big bins
 and the best pudding was fruit
 and shortbread mixed stewed fruit which was really quite nice
 and bits of shawbread
 and that was nice everything else was rubbish except we used to get rice pudding with raw sip syrup
 and i like the raw sip syrup
 so you've have a spoonful of that
 and that was it manchester tart that was do you have that it was kind of * * * * * * your base with a newb jam
 and then cold custard on right actually that sounds a bit odd customer probably was
 but i just i expected not to like smoothen us
 so i tended not to meet them those are games did let go let's go let's go play times marbles or jellies take a primary school when hula hoop first came out
 and got paid green 1 girls girls would have the ropes stripping ropes football results right
 no not near all the windows in the school check football just stood in corners
 and talked a lot sophisticated i remember all this afterwards you get away find it again sometimes
 and then the p used to be outside
 and you got these woven mats there were sort of oval mats
 and you all had to take a mat out
 and put on the playground
 and sort of line it
 and do exercises things as the weather was dry
 yeah wasn't comfortable if it was warm in the summer because we did have plainfield hours very school we're about running races
 and doing things like that
 but never played anything like football or cricket school not even in in pe sessions
 no did you get pe for that
 no
 no
 yes
 but then in those days it was just you just had 1 teacher for the whole year who taught you subjects practical subjects
 and pe
 and whatever else is is primary school then specialist they weren't sharing that's that's true now is it not not sure we have a gym teacher
 and you have a
 no i don't
 well not in my day you had the same teacher that's very different
 well the signature we did i don't know don't you get i don't believe it's changed nomadic teachers what's the other pathetic ok peripatetic
 well you do you do for us a concern i don't think you do for the things like news are
 yes like gym hmm don't worry we won't give her name at
 well she plays badminton with us or she takes them for badly enough
 so she teaches badminton it's a primary which seems to be a sort of regular thing it's not an after school activity i don't think because i remember saying today that she'd said to them certain things i have to be you have to be here for
 but you know
 so badminton if you don't behave that can throw you out hmm
 so it must be a following something just be thought out from you know go
 and sit
 and watch you're not playing you're bad
 no
 no
 no
 no i think it was their own free will after school time lunchtime that's what we have
 oh
 yes i remember mother used to work in a chocolate factory in dundee called lindsay
 and rowe what can you tell me i don't know i just knew it was a chocolate factory it was something i kind of grew up knowing she used to say kind of put you off chocolate a bit i was gon na ask you
 no she did get a taste back for it after she left remember doing nothing
 and grandparents in running feast lived in a the bottom floor of the tenement in
 oh
 well
 well side place or something remember they used to go in the dark close
 and there's this probably doesn't just it's off to the right nose
 but to be tiny we sort of kitchen area could get out in there's a lovely green at the back
 and the wash houses at the far end there's a flower border right up the top of the flats
 and a very old tortoise lived there called toby used to see reputedly about 100 years old
 but it probably wasn't
 no big big feather bed in the corner of the sort of living room
 but did have a bedroom
 but there's also you
 and the sort of
 yes big featherbed which was lovely the fine place with the
 so we see that you could sit beside in gluc
 no just you used to get fireplaces built in sinks up at the corner like those sort of stool things did they have a built in toilet an indoor toilet properly docks i doubt it
 but i can't actually remember that although i must have used it because we used to go there for week at a time visiting my father's cousin
 well auntie mine was down the corner in brook street
 and she had her they had an inside toilet
 but they didn't have a bathroom the time clinic kitchen
 so what i don't know a tin bath to use in front of the fire we just used to get washed washed in the kitchen at the kitchen sink
 well you when you were visiting
 but how about other adults who lived i don't know there
 but they were posh because they had a front room with a piano in it it was a bedroom as
 well
 but ok used to 2 lines of thought i was going on at the same time you used to have roller skates didn't you the roller skates i had to i had roll skates
 yes was that when they were quite new i had
 no clue when roller skates were introduced right
 so you don't have a time belt my cousin ian's down in griffs after him
 and he asked didn't you think never wore to did you alternate to save the tyres didn't have tyres or metal wheels
 no
 and i didn't
 yeah my first 1 is a metal wheels i'm sure
 and they made a heck all all shiny little frame a rocket when you went down the street that not underneath it used to adjust the length on them that was at my first pair of roller skates
 well we want to put into the jumble sale down at the school there's something about it that's where i don't remember that time listening about it or did they used to bend or something went after i finished wism or where i got from killed somebody now there was something wrong with it was it was it walking wheel or something
 but you could get a new word what you tyres for was a sort of square wheel on it
 but whether anyone would ever bother putting another
 yeah i know that's really very good for breaking
 oh that kind of breaking
 yes
 yes right here i go probably as
 well yep
 so
 and will you also not 1 of the first people in scotland to have jeans right what's the story
 yes quite arguably my father's sister in america i used to send over parcels 2 or 3 times a year i thought you got them when were out there
 no
 oh
 no it's long before we'll wait for that it was when i got my first 2 wheel bike political i think my 9th birthday that was 13th
 and it's just about then the parcel arrived
 and there was a pair of jeans in it for me
 and along with a sort of cowboy shot checked quite warm sure
 yes there's nothing quite like that he was just standing out here scott
 and beach with the boat i just get it
 no he did he did we talked about it last week when we were johnny the beach down the west coast of scotland is that way
 no that was aimov actually about that photograph student
 but did you go down to down to air down to largs
 and
 yes got my first holiday ever with an air on when you too young to remember it somebody like thoughts new had a house here
 yeah i guess i saw just they lived there please stay with it
 oh i see used to go to the north east as
 well didn't you
 no i thought to know if you want then i thought
 no i thought you went into it a disaster right once we're at aberdeen for the holidays
 so disaster now we went to a broth more often went to saint andrews
 and we did a1 holiday in eyemouth
 no aberdeen was a disaster because the daughter of the the people who had the the boarding house was called those days sort of stealing from virgin oops
 and the police were involved in all that rather tainted out you have aberdeen i just there's not all that up
 no maybe not
 but you know something happens like that you have a bad impression of the whole place
 yeah since i don't remember the weather been particularly good or just a big city after all isn't really a holiday place we'll add the beach ballroom
 and it wasn't in that bowman 2 things numbering beats colubrin it's still going thought she was trying to
 no it's probably probably more like a competitive famous it's always been famous with the beach body problem this is a boulder or is it like a club
 no other father once i stop going on holidays with them went to this is oops on the black isle area i sort of elen elgin elen there's 1 place in particular
 oh
 yeah that's right i was sort of around there from where they were based pit new pits ligo
 yeah i knew peter head isn't it up a bit
 well it's inland quite a bit
 yeah
 yeah that area used to get your meals included didn't you it was boarding house
 and used to get all your meals
 well you had either of a full board or half board or you had attendance early years after the war do you mean by attendance the landlady cooked your own food for you i suppose it was time to rationing
 and landladies couldn't go out
 and buy what needed for all the borders
 so you took your own coupons you got 12 you either got your own food in or you gave the coupons to the landlady
 and she went
 and registered them that her phone whoever
 and it's an effective is your food
 and she just made it
 so that was because of your
 but he was in russian still being a feature
 but
 yes did you already do much in scotland when you were young before you moved here
 well
 yes it might steve relative money faith was the the usual place used to come up usually just with my mum you're not to be working apart from that the first holiday i remember was in red car in the caravan
 and i think it rained all day
 and i remember buying a little she learned about some sister night with there
 and we bought little ornaments
 and 1 was a little sort of woman with a barrel beside him kept matches him
 and the other had a little sort of apron on it changed colour blue when it was going to rain
 and pink when it's going to be dry or something
 and i remember there used to be in the sort of display cupboard bit at home
 and i broke 1 of them 1 day when i hid the bits in the sugar bowl nobody would ever that didn't know anything about it when they were found none i think you didn't get away with it
 no i think the suspect
 yeah we used to go
 so quickly my dad's at work at a caravan he used to to drive us through to the caravan site there or we'd go to scarborough because it was cricket there
 but i'd like the to play or just watch let me just watch money face with something the place i came to which most often was the much there's probably more now certainly more houses
 but you suck in
 and sort of visit relatives
 and we went to the beach played on on the beach remember visiting the cousin she was in the school on the mains on high street
 and moneythe
 and we went along 1 day at play time
 and spoke through the room i've been at the same i don't have been anything on the beach except used to collect shelves
 and further along you'll only be able to go
 so far along because it was barry budden which was that an army campus
 and then the other way was bosque ferry which was where my mom
 and dad had met because my dad was stationed there trump in the army
 so they met through that are we still there or are you doing that something's going on another question how long was he there
 and now because he was abroad as
 well wasn't he
 oh
 yes it was abroad during the war he joined the army early he gave a false birth sir
 so he always reckoned he had 2 birthdays like the queen
 but you can't remember age you wasn't enjoying
 but i've got to papers
 and things upstairs somewhere you must have been stationed up there before he was sent abroad why brought you
 and just because it's sort of out the way
 and heavy industry
 and indeed right
 and in fact
 well my mom lived there after she was born in 1939
 and my dad must have gone abroad then or shortly after then i can't remember he's abroad when she was born to think
 so
 and my mom lived with her parents when he faced for a long
 and then when they moved south sheila can remember the lived with my my gran that's my dad's mother in stockton because she remembers it it was a dark house
 and she was scared going upstairs because it's dark
 and everything she didn't like it
 and then by the time i was born we'd moved to norway because i was 8 years younger still baby poor baby boomer
 well
 no it's really the year before because the year before visit school had an extra streaming it because there were
 so many really i thought from to hours
 well
 yeah
 but
 well it must have slackened off a bit after the first we used to have lots of postcards
 and things that my dad sent photographs
 and sent them to all particular he was in india
 and i'm sure he was in africa as
 well india
 and london pictures of him with a horse
 and he was a gunner picked him standing beside his big gun
 and stuff my controls what comments just tell you the medals you've got which champions are it will do i'm sure it will
 but it was certainly in india couldn't be even about it
 and then nina didn't want to travel after that he said he travelled enough during the war
 so he's never interested in going anywhere ok you saw that ok ok
