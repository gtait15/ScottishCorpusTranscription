 so i'm going to take you away back can you think about what your earliest memory is yes my earliest memory would be i was born in 19 44
 so my earliest memory would probably be about 19 47 or 8 when i was 4 year old
 and i had gone to the ponds to get some fish
 and i had a jam jar with some string round it
 and i had a fishing net
 and i had about 15 little minnows in the water
 and i was really really happy
 so i brought it back
 and i was climbing up the stairs to go into the house to show off my catch
 and the a girl who lived above me who sadly was down's syndrome
 and
 and was a wee bit aggressive came up the stairs grabbed the jar swung it as hard as she could smashed it against the wall
 and all the fish were in a big puddle on the steps squirming about
 and the just the noise of the glass crashing
 and then all these little minnows squirming in the pond was just too much for me
 and i evidently ran off you know yellin my head off
 and i don't know what happened to her
 but then you know she she couldn't really help it was just she wasn't she wasn't right sheila her name was
 and that's that's 1 of my earliest memories that was that when you lived in cragie street cragie street in the tenement a room
 and a kitchen 5 of us in that house well there was 6
 but then my dad died 5 of us in that house my mum 2 brothers
 and a sister
 and myself
 and i was the youngest
 and the toilet was on the stair there was no electricity until just before we left that we had gas gas lamps
 and we left cragie street in well i was 7
 so that would have been 19 50 we left cragie street in just it was just before that that they got electric lighting in these houses the outside was lit by gas lamp you know the outside lights in the street
 and on the stairs the man the came at night
 and put the lights on
 and came in the morning
 and put them off there was an actual
 and he came with a great big long pole that he would cause the the gas lamps were really high up to keep them away from the kids
 so he came up with a great big long pole
 and i i don't know how he did it
 but he just seemed to stick the pole into the glass
 and the light either went on or it went off've never yet what that pole was all about yeah
 but that was what he did
 so it was a it was a a colourful place live in many ways
 and how old were you were you how old were you when your dad died i was just comin up for 2 when my dad died he had some some injuries in the war
 and when he came home from the war he was most unwell
 and he developed tuberculosis
 and there was no cure for tuberculosis in these days
 so he was put into hospital
 and when it became clear that he was goin to die my mum took him out of the hospital we were all sent out of the house because it was
 so contagious tuberculosis
 so we were put away from the house you know ferried out to different people to look after us
 and my mum looked after him
 and then he died
 and the 5 of us stayed on in the house until as i say 19 50
 and then we were sent out to what to me was the country
 and was a bungalow
 and the council had started to decant people from the central centre of the city out to the housing schemes which virtually were built in the country certainly for us townies we were surrounded by fields in the housing estate that we were sent to is that prefab that was in fintry right
 and there was 3 bedrooms there was a bath which was a huge luxury there was a bath
 and a toilet
 and of course the biggest luxury was that it was indoors you know we didn't have to go out to the toilet
 and we had a proper kitchen
 and a
 and a front
 and back door
 and a garden
 and that was incredible for for i mean i only had a short experience of my life in a tenement
 but for people who were born
 and bred
 and brought up in tenements all their lives to move out to a council house in the country with all these facilities was just amazing
 but 1 of the problems with that was the council were not very because they put people out there
 but there was no infrastructure built the roads weren't completed
 so there was no transport could come out there there was no shops
 so it meant that people had to walk into town now it wasn't that far it wasn't that far
 but it did mean a hike into town for shopping then they started through time to have some vans come out you know a baker van would come out
 and a butcher van
 and a fish van
 but of course they were expensive because they you know they had their overheads for their vehicles
 so most people trekked into the town
 and then gradually gradually shops were built as the schemes developed
 and got bigger cause we were in the first street that was ever built in fintry it was called fintry gardens
 and that was the first street of this what is now a huge housing estate
 but when the as i say when the first street was built there was there was there was no i mean there was actually no the road wasn't built the houses were built
 and they were complete
 but there was no road you know
 so it was a kind of a muddy track up to the houses sounds incredible because it's all laid out now
 and everything's you know you know all the roads are complete
 and there's a huge infrastructure now there's schools
 and shops
 and you know clinics
 and all those kind of thing there now
 but there wasn't in these days
 but anyway nevertheless i thought i had died
 and gone to heaven because it was just incredible in fact i kept runnin evidently i don't remember this
 but evidently i kept runnin through the house it was such a novelty to go in 1 door run through the house
 and out the other door it was a huge a huge novelty
 and then like every other novelty it just became you know it just wore off
 and it was just your house
 and that was fine
 but
 and you were you at school age yeah well there's another story wi that my my mum i had gone to the school glebelands which was near to cragie street
 and
 so when i moved out to the housing scheme my mother i think the next day my mother took me to the window
 and pointed to the wee school that was in the field a few fields away there was a wee school in the field
 and she said to me see that that building there
 and i said yeah she said that's the school you're going to tomorrow
 and of course i did my usual you know i don't wan na go to that school because you know i've got all my my friends are at glebelands i don't wan na go there'oh well you've no choice that's where you're going
 and the next day she took me down to the corner of the street
 and 2 girls 1 was called ruth gold
 and 1 was called dorothy wright i remember them
 so clearly
 and she said to them you goin down to that school
 and they said yes
 and said well take her with you that's true now they would be maybe a year older than me know they bigger than me
 but they took me to the school
 and they took me in to the headmaster
 and said this is the new girl she's starting here today
 so he said you know what's your name gave him my name
 and he said go along to room 4
 and i just had to walk along the corridor
 and go into room 4
 and the teacher there said just come in she'd looked at the register she was obviously expecting me looked at the register
 and said just sit down there
 and my my worry was that on the blackboard they were doin writing writing
 and
 and she said to to the class now i want you to copy this passage into your jotter
 and she handed me a split new jotter
 and a split new pencil
 and
 and i said oh i'm sorry
 but i don't do that kind of writing
 and she said well you do now that's the kind of writing we do here
 so having gone from just you know i don't know what you call the the writing scripture to the to the writing was what i it shifted from that in a matter of a morning
 and
 and then came home
 and was showin off that i could now write in in big people's writing you know big people that was the way big people wrote
 so that was my that was my jotter
 and i was very pleased with that i was worried to begin with
 but you know i was very pleased with that
 and i loved that school i actually loved that school it was called linlathen primary
 and 1 of my teachers ah was a lady called eleanor leith that we of course called miss leith
 and
 but she told us her name was eleanor
 and she i was a bit of a mischief
 but she seemed to like me
 and 1 day i would i had a sore tooth
 and because i mean we didn't have a dentist or anything god i don't think i had a toothbrush in these days never mind a dentist
 but anyway she said what's wrong with you because i'd maybe been mumpin
 and sulkin cause i was in pain with this tooth
 and i told her i had a sore tooth
 and she says well get your mummy to take you to the dentist
 and
 and i said oh well my mum doesn't have time to do that you see because you know i mean we don't know where the dentist is
 and all this nonsense
 so she said well i tell you what she said i'll take you to a dentist
 and at 4o'clock i got to sit in her car that was a huge excitement i got to sit in her car
 and she took me to this dentist down in stobswell we went in we went up the stairs it was up a stair we went up the stair it was a bit scary because i'd never been in a dentist
 and all the instruments were there
 and everything
 but the great thing was on his on the radio which was in his the surgery bit he had scottish music playing
 and all the time the music was playing he was singing along to it you know i mean it was
 and he sat me in the chair
 and gave me a swirl round let us swirl around a wee bit he knew i was frightened
 and miss leith just popped her head in
 and then popped her head out again
 and he did whatever he did to the tooth i don't know whether he i don't even know whether he pulled it out or whether he filled it that i can't remember
 but he he looked after the the tooth anyway
 and he he gave me a little a little round tin of toothpaste
 and a tiny little brush he just gave it to me to take home he cause he said do you do you brush your teeth often
 and i said no did you not have a have a toothbrush or toothpaste
 so he gave me the toothpaste
 and the toothbrush
 and he said now when you go home you need to brush your teeth in the morning before you go to school
 and at night before you go to bed
 and he said you have very good teeth
 but you want to keep them keep them good do you eat many sweeties
 and i said no because we didn't we didn't get sweeties
 but for some reason 1 of my tooth had gone a bit my teeth had gone a bit bad
 so that was that
 and it was the next day at school when when miss leith ran me back to to where i lived by that time now we were in a prefab
 and
 so she ran me back to my to the house or or to the street where i lived anyway
 and i jumped out the car
 and she said to me did you notice the name on the dentist's did you notice the name on the plaque outside
 and i said no i never even noticed the plaque never mind the name
 and she said well the name says gordon leith dental surgeon
 and gordon leith is my father
 and i says your father's a dentist
 and she said yes she said
 so now i went to that dentist for years after that you know went every 6 months or whatever it was you know for your
 and
 and kept up you know with the dentist for many many years after that until i went to mr butt know that you've that you the first dentist i can remember leith died cause i mean he was a good he was a good age when you know he was quite elderly when i went with that night with miss leith
 so he was a good age
 and he died
 and then i didn't have a dentist for a wee while
 and then i started going to mr butt
 and then he was the dentist after that looked after you folk's teeth as well
 but yeah i loved that school was a great yeah yeah she was a really really nice person miss leith
 and she was really she used to give us all a christmas present everybody got a the whole class got a christmas present it was just a small thing you know maybe a penny dainty or something like that
 but the great thing was that you got called out of the your desk you got you got called out of your seat to come
 and get it you felt
 so important you know
 and she always kept me till last i was always last cause i i was alphabetically i was last we'd nobody behind me alphabetically cause i was t for tait
 and
 and
 and i was always last
 and the anticipation cause it was always in a little brown a little brown paper bag
 so you didn't know what what you were gon na get
 and everyone got something a wee bitty different
 and oh the anticipation of that was amazing
 and then you would go out
 and she would say something like well i hope you have a very nice christmas
 and take care on the roads
 and we'll see you after the after the holiday you know she always said that every year we had her for 2 3 years i think
 so she she sticks in my memory as far as teachers are concerned cause she was
 so kind
 and she was really kind as well to all the naughty ones you know how you know includin myself you had these naughty people
 and she she was the 1 as well when she'd said i was misbehaving 1 day
 and she said to me right get out she says i can't remember did now she say outside no yeah she said out
 and i didn't mean i didn't know whether she meant'out the class or'out the school out of dundee or out of everything
 so i thought well if you stand outside the door
 and the headmaster comes along you get into trouble cause he knows you've been put out for being naughty
 so i thought well the only thing to do is go home
 and i went right out the school
 and the thing was i knew that that if i got home once i got home there would be nobody in i i would be stuck because my mum was working olive was at school my brother was home on leave from the army
 but i wasnae very sure about that whether he would be home anyway it was a winter's day a dark day
 and when i came up to near the prefab i could see the light on in the bathroom
 so i phew i knew he was in
 so i went in
 and he said to me why are you home you should be at school
 and
 and i first of all said i was sick
 and i wasn't feelin well i was feelin sick
 so that was first of all i thought i'd try that tack
 and he said to me this is neil
 and he said to me you don't look sick
 and i said i've got a really sore tummy
 and eventually it came out that i'd been put out cause i was wantin to ask him whether she meant'out forever or just'out
 so he said well if you've been naughty i think you've probably been told to get out of the classroom not out of the whole school
 and certainly not out of education the education system
 so he said now you know know what you've to do
 and i said no he says well you've to go right back after lunch time
 and you've to stand at her desk
 and when the school bell rings you line up then you go to her you go to the school get into the classroom go to her desk
 and say'miss leith i'm really sorry for misbehaving this morning
 and i won't do it again
 and
 and i said well no see i can't do that because everybody'll laugh
 and he says well that's why you've to do it that's why you've got to say you're really sorry
 and you won't do it again
 and i was going back down the road saying i'm not doin that i'm not doing that i'm just going to sit in the classroom
 and i'm not saying anything i'm just gon na go in go to my desk
 and sit down
 and i went into the classroom
 and i don't know why i did this i don't know why i did it to this day
 but i sort of sidled up to the desk
 and she was trying not to look at me she could see me out the corner of her eye
 but she was trying not to look at me eventually she turned round
 and she said yes
 and i said what neil said for me to say with great difficulty
 but
 but i said it
 and she just said 1 word sit
 and
 so i just turned from the desk
 and sat
 but then i was happy because i thought phew i'm back in again you know i wasnae quite sure how things were gon na go if i was'out forever you know how was i gon na learn things or or when could i play in the playground if i wasn't at the school you know
 so i was happy to be back in that school system were quite known for that kind of thing though weren't you because there was the time in nursery as well when you just sort of went awol can you tell us about that well it was actually awol from school because oh see i brought up in the nursery
 and i was in the nursery when i was months old cause my mum had to go to work
 and there was all these council nurseries where babies were taken in because it was just after the war
 and you know things were very very different
 and anyway i was brought up in ellengowan nursery every day i went there
 and i was virtually just taken home at night
 and put to bed
 so the nursery was my home the nursery was my was really like my home
 and when i went to school i i went to school the first day went you know was taken in registered
 and everything
 and at when we came out to play i just walked out the school
 and walked back to the nursery which was within walkin distance of the school i just went right back to the nursery because i thought well it's time to go home now i've had enough of that
 and then i had evidently appeared at a window they had very low windows in this nursery school the windows were deliberately low you know the the windows actually came down quite low
 so that the the nurses could see out if the children were playin out
 but i had looked in the window of the matron of the the
 and she was sittin at her desk writing
 and she looked up
 and she said evidently she said to my mum all she could see was this head of blonde curls lookin in the in the window
 and thinkin oh god she's back she's gone oh god we've got her back
 so she she beckoned to me to come in
 so when i went into her room she said to me what are you doing here
 and i said well i just came back because i've been to school now
 and it was okay
 but that's it
 and she said no no you don't come back here audrey you have to stay at school you're at school now you don't come to nursery school
 and the she phoned the school
 and said you'll have to send her sister along for her now olive was in a few primaries above me you'll have to send her sister for her
 so olive came for me dragging me along the road cause she was fed up she'd been taken out of a class that she was really enjoying maybe art or something
 and she had to come
 and collect me
 so she took me back now after that i think i was the start of them locking gates
 and things in cause they didna lock the gate i just walked out of the gate
 and i never actually did go back to the nursery school
 but i was really sad you know because it it really was my my life the nursery school it was my home for for all these years
 and the nurses were like mums really you know the nurses the nursery nurses were all because you were taken there like my mum started in the mills at she would probably start at half 7 quarter to 8
 so i'd be taken there at the back of 7 just after 7
 and then i wouldn't be picked up until half 5 quarter to 6 at night
 and then of course you know my mum would be tired
 so i would be taken home
 and bathed or or maybe not even bathed just taken home
 and put to bed really
 so that's why it was important that the nursery that's why the nursery school was
 so important to me
 and what was your granny doing was she also working in the mills when you were that age yeah yeah yeah you see there was nobody to look after you because everybody you know my mum's sisters
 and brothers were all in the mill
 and they all did a they all did a a different job
 and my my mum was a which just is exactly what it says she wound the the flax onto the spools
 and there was a 1 of my other aunts was a weaver
 and there was a finisher
 and there was a flattener
 and a there was a sparker
 and oh there was all the different trades of of the jute industry
 and they all worked in different parts of it you know my mum said at 1 stage there was a member of the family in every every sector of the mill right at the beginning
 and then because the the flax goes through different processes you know it arrives off the ships from or you know it arrived off the ships from pakistan
 and then it went through various processes
 and my mum reckoned that at 1 stage you know the family had all grown up
 and at 1 stage there was 1 of them in each in each area of the mill how many siblings did nanna have well she was the oldest of 13 she had she had 12 brothers
 and sisters i i i think there was 6 girls
 and 7 boys 6 girls
 and 7 boys twins joseph
 and james they died in infancy they were about 4 months old evidently when they died
 but that was common long ago sadly because that was before inoculations
 and that's when things were people with that size of a family certainly couldn't afford to nourish them all you know they weren't they wouldn't be all i wouldn't have thought
 and they lived a very hard life in a very very small house in the centre of the town near the docks
 and my mum bein the oldest had all the work had a lot of work to do you know besides her besides her job she'd a lot of work to do in the house with the children
 and it it doesna sound like a great life it wasn't a good life what about your mum's dad was he my my mum's can't remember yeah he was called joseph
 and he was he was a bit of a dead loss really as my mum would put it because he drank very heavily
 and he worked he worked on the docks he worked he was a what they call a plater
 and that was a skill that that was to do with plating was to do with you know puttin the outside pieces on the on the actual ship
 and
 so that's what my grandfather did
 but very often he was never at his work cause he couldn't lift his head off the pillow if he was really drunk
 but my granny used to be able to go down
 and get his wages she would go to the docks
 and they knew what my grandfather was like
 and they knew that she had this huge family
 and she used to get his wages just picked up his wages he didn't touch his wages
 and
 but she said he always got money somewhere for drink she's never never yet really knew where he got
 but he always managed to get the money for drink
 so she had a very hard life extremely hard life
 and yet she was very tough very resilient i mean she was in her eighties
 and she was still helpin you know washin nappies for her various you know grandchildren
 and whatever else
 so she was really a bit of a character that's the 1 that thought i was a boy wasn't it yes yes she couldnae get round your name cerwyss she couldn't she i mean cerwyss that was she'd never heard of it of course
 but then i mean it sounded really like a boy
 so couldnae couldnae cope with that at all
 but yeah i think they had a a really really hard time
 and when my mum was expecting me this just gives you an idea of the sort of the culture of the time when my mum was expecting me her her mum who was my gran had gone to the pictures they'd gone to see a film
 and they were sitting in the pictures
 and my mum you know the her due date was a few weeks away
 so
 but she started to feel really uncomfortable in the pictures
 and she'd said to my gran i'm not really not feeling too good
 so my gran said oh well she listened to her saying that for a wee while
 and eventually she said oh come on we'll walk up the road
 so they started to walk up the road
 and walking up the road was becoming more
 and more uncomfortable for my mum it wasn't that far
 but it was up a hill
 and she was
 and she really was uncomfortable anyway they got up to the circle round about where my granny lived cause they were goin back to my granny's
 and her my mum's brothers several of my mum's brothers were hangin about on the corner as they did in these days
 so my granny says you better go down for the midwife
 and my my my mum had evidently said oh i don't think i'm needin a midwife she said i think i've still got a bit to go yet
 but she said i'm really uncomfortable
 and my granny said to thomas go
 and get the midwife
 so thomas took to his heels
 and ran down though to find the midwife by which time now i we had got well my mum
 and my gran had got home
 and my mum my gran said to my mum now you'd better go through
 and lie down cause she had been lookin a bit white
 and poorly
 so she went through to lie down
 and i came into the world
 and my gran said the midwife arrived
 and my gran had just said too late you know she's the baby's born
 so my my gran virtually brought me into the world hmm
 so that was you know that was that
 and evidently my gran had brought brought quite a few people you know a few of the neighbours that had gone into to labour too quick you know the the midwives didn't get there in time my gran thought nothing of it well i mean she'd had 13 of her own she knew fine she maybe delivered some of them she knew fine what to do
 and
 and
 and
 so on
 so i mean it was quite nice cause she used to tell me years later that you know she had brought me into the world
 and fortunately it was quite an easy birth you know there was no complication i'm sure if there's complications then you have to get into hospital
 but most babies in these days were born at home
 and you only went into hospital to have your baby in these days if there was a complication most infants were born at home
 so my granny certainly brought me into the world
 and the was it common was it common for men to be round no in these days oh no oh no it wasn't common for men to be around when you were born some men did it some men chose to do it
 but it wasn't common
 and i think a lot of it i don't even think it was
 so much the men didn't want to be there the hospital didn't want them there it was they've changed you see that's all changed now wi the hospital
 and i think it's changed for the better the hospital recognises that mums want the dad there want their husbands there in some cases
 but in in certainly in my mum's day oh my god my my my dad well certainly my dad was at sea you know he was in the navy
 and he was away with the war
 but i would have doubted if he would have been there
 and none of the the boys were allowed in the room you know none of the the brothers or certainly my brothers were allowed into the room yeah it was very very different in these days
 but i think i think my mum by the time i came along had probably just had enough babies you know she'd had brought up practically brought up all her own siblings
 and then she had 4 4 of her own
 so i think she'd just well had enough by that time yeah that's right that's right
 so i mean it was hard it was hard for her there's no doubt about it
 but yeah it just seems it doesn't seem that long ago
 but yet in some ways it's a million from from nowadays you know how things have
 and some things have definitely changed for the better
 but i still think some things were were better in our day in that you know we could we could play in the street there was no cars i mean cars never came along our street cars i was in i was i wasn't in a car until i was about 7 because
 and the only reason i was in a car was because i was a flower girl at our neighbour's wedding
 and olive
 and i got to sit in a in a car
 and we thought that was amazing
 and i i got gloves that was another amazing thing i got the i mean i didn't worry when you i was like you when you were little girls you never liked dresses
 and things neither did i
 and the only way i would wear the dress was i had gloves i got to wear these gloves
 and i remember my mum sayin to me it's ridiculous you know she doesnae like wearin the dress
 but she's happy to wear the gloves
 so for some reason we had these little white you know
 and i thought i was i was really something in these gloves
 and yeah
 so you think do you think it was much safer then for children or do you think it's just that you hear more about what goes on now you think it was generally safer i think it was generally safer
 and yet i was taken away from the street
 but we won't go into that
 but i think it was generally safer
 and the reason for that is that an awful lot of the neighbours hung around the street more there was more community spirit i think then
 and that might be just because even of the layout of the houses i don't know
 but there seemed to in in our street there was a 2 shops on the end of the street you know there was a a greengrocer
 and a grocer like a a
 and a
 and a grocer
 and the the the ladies of the street certainly the elderly ladies of the street used to sit on the shop windowsills
 and you know share their snuff boxes
 and chatter away of an evening you know they were all there was always somebody in the street
 so of course when kids were playing you know if they fell over or they were unwell or they were fighting something these elderly ladies were unwittingly babysitters you know cause they'd say hey stop that or you know they would they would get involved in some fracas if if anything was happening
 and i think that culture has gone i think that culture's gone because people are well i don't i think i think it might have just been the layout of the buildings
 and everything i'm not sure
 and the fact that it was there was no traffic came along the
 and there was no buses you see in these days it was
 and the came down the main street because of the the cable line yes
 so the street really was a a playground the street was the playground
 and we had the park we had baxter park
 but then you couldn't go up to baxter park unless somebody took you there you know cause it was a fair wee step for us
 but the boys you know my brothers they they played in the street they played football in the street
 and there was there was shelters round the back in our close you know for the war
 and of course they weren't taken down even after the war finished
 so the best thing in the world was to climb on the top of them
 and they would be maybe 9 10 feet high you know they weren't that high
 but high when you're wee
 and of course you weren't allowed on them there was a big rule
 and kids weren't allowed on the top they were allowed to go in them
 but they weren't allowed to go on the top of them
 and there were all manner of wee sort of wooden ladders
 and things
 and wee wee sort of wee piles of stones that that would be erected to get you up onto the top
 and they were all hidden round from the from the windows hidden round the back
 so that your mum if she looked out she couldnae see you climbin onto the shelter
 and you never climbed on a shelter of course that was within sight of your own window everybody went to another shelter
 and there was 1 day that olive
 and i were you know they had got me up onto the i was only about 3 seemingly
 and they'd got me up onto this shelter
 and i mean we were just we just felt we were
 so mischievous
 and we were bein
 so you know on the top of this shelter
 and i can remember actually being a bit wimpy
 and thinkin you know it seemed
 so high once i got up there i thought'oh
 and then the next thing was the policeman came through the big pend
 and all we could see was the top of his helmet
 and olive says to me lie flat on your face
 and don't say a word
 so i'm on the top of this shelter
 and little did we know that this guy could just stand on the pile of stones that we got up on
 and then we could see his whole head lookin across
 and all he did he was a great big man
 and all he did was put over his massive hand pluck me off of this shelter
 and you know lift me down
 but dropped me about a foot from the
 so that
 so that i didn't get down with too much ease
 and
 and then he licked his pencil sheafed through his to get to the right page
 and then he said name
 so of course your name went in the policeman's book
 and the idea now was the policeman was gon na go to your door
 and tell your mum you'd been on the shelters
 so olive
 and i decided we were actually going to have to run away we could not go home because the punishment would fit the crime
 and the crime was bad
 and the punishment would be worse
 so we thought well we'll just make a run for it
 so we went out the close
 and we got along to the end of the street
 and olive just kept sayin to me just keep followin me just keep followin me
 and then we looked up the street
 and all we could see was my gran comin down albert street bustling as she did you know she always came down as though she was on a mission she came down
 and she shouts to olive you come here
 so of course she'd seen the 2 of us you see
 so olive goes up what're you doin what're you doin on the end of the street you werenae supposed to be on the end of the street you see you were all supposed to be on the middle of the street
 so olive said oh we're just we're just lookin for somebody she said well get that meant get meant get home
 so we just turned tail
 and went back
 and we we sort of sat outside for a while thinkin well has he been yet has has he been to the door yet or or will he go after cause we thought well we need to go we need to get some tea sometime we werenae sure whether we should
 and have the tea
 and then get the belting or or we should just not go
 but i i'm not i mean i've got this story in my head
 and i'm not just sure what happened
 but certainly we never got into trouble
 so i don't think the guy ever went near the door i don't think the policeman did
 but on sayin that we never went on the shelters again because we just got such a fright that if my mum like if a policeman ever went to your door i mean that was the end of the you can you remember rations mum did you still rations had right up until we didn't have ration books in fintry
 so i would imagine i think 19 or would be the end of the rationing i think
 and that's why we'd never any sweeties because you did get coupons for sweeties
 but you could swap them for coupons for an egg this kind of thing
 and of course i mean sweeties were were for rich children you know
 so we never ever got sweeties i can remember gettin an easter egg when i was quite big when i say that maybe 8 or 9 from my uncle john bought olive
 and i an easter egg
 and i mean you just thought all your birthdays had come together a an easter egg to yourself
 and we were in woolworth's
 and the woman went to put mine in a bag you know put it in a bag
 and i didn't want it in a bag cause i had to show it off i wanted everybody in the world to see this easter egg
 and really show it off that it was mine
 and of course my mum confiscated the easter egg as soon as we got home the easter egg was put into the cupboard
 and we were only allowed a tiny little bit every day
 and she was allowed a tiny little bit of our easter egg every day
 so with the result that easter egg lasted seemed to last forever
 but we just we just
 and i mean you you couldnae steal it you know i mean you couldnae that did occur to us we thought pfff we could go
 and steal a bit more
 but she knew she knew what stage that easter egg was at
 so you could not steal it
 and
 and i reckon i've got a theory on this cause i reckon that's why we all had good teeth you know we never had a bloomin toothbrush
 but then we never had sweeties
 and we didn't have biscuits you know we didn't have a lot of sweet things didn't have really a lot of anything
 but you certainly didn't have a lot of sweet things
 but yeah i've got a lot of got a lot of happy memories i don't have memories sadly of like ever getting on my mum's knee or getting a story or i mean we didn't have any story books or i loved i loved goin to the the little story story classes in the library there was little classes where you could primaries 1 2
 and 3 got allowed to go to the library
 and a lady would come
 and read a story to you
 and that was great i loved that cause she she this lady would make all the characters come to life you know she would speak like the character did
 and i always thought that was really clever because because she became that character in the book you know
 but after you came out of primary 3 that was it you know you never got another story in your life again that was the end of the stories
 so i i don't have memories of that kind of home life
 but i have i have happy memories of of situations
 and incidents at school
 and outside of home life you know i have that when did you start going skating because that was a thing that yeah skating i started to go when i was probably in 12 right yeah i started goin when i was 12 i started to try
 and learn to skate that was a laugh cause you spent more time on the on the ice than you did on your feet
 but
 but eventually you know after years of years of ploddin on became quite a good skater certainly quite a good speed skater used to like to go up at the what they called the ladies speed
 and you know the ladies would go
 and go round as fast as they could
 and then there was the men's speed
 and then there was the dancing
 and i didn't i wasn't good enough for that
 but is that dancing yeah they danced on ice yeah yeah maureen golden i remember maureen golden the first time i ever saw her ever saw her was on the ice
 and it was only after i met up with her years later i said to her i recognise you you used to be an a skater didn't you
 and she said yeah she had the most beautiful costumes i remember she always had different costumes on
 and she was very very good she was a great skater
 and i used to love watchin it at that time most people just went away
 and had a cup of tea or a drink of juice when the these intervals were on
 but i always stayed i always just liked to watch them
 and a few couples would go
 and do the dancing together it really it really was good
 but yeah i liked skating
 and what did you wear when you went to the skating well i got a pair of i thought i was really i was really something i got a pair of wine burgundy corduroy trousers
 and a white jumper
 and that was really trendy in these days that was really trendy
 and i can remember i had a i had a cause cause girls wore skating skirts in these days
 and i can remember just not liking it cause i thought it was too long
 and i said to olive you know my sister could you could you could you shorten that for me you know mrs said could you could you shorten that for me
 and
 so she starts to pin it up a bitty you see
 and i says no i want it shorter than that i want it shorter than that
 and she was saying you can't get it any shorter than that for goodness sake
 and i think it was neil neil came in
 and you know came in on all this nonsense
 and me saying i want it shorter than that
 and
 and he said no you don't he said it's that's a good length the way that is just now
 and he said always remember it's what people don't see that's more what they see
 and i've never
 so anyway i got my skirt at the the decent length
 and
 and that was that
 but we didn't wear skirts too long or or too you know it was mostly trousers it was mostly trousers cause it was cold you know
 and if you went down wi the on you know you were you were soaking you know
 and the your trousers gave you a wee bitty more protection
 and it was great fun i loved the skating that's where i met my first boyfriend bill heron that's where i met him
 but he really fancied my friend he fancied my friend carol raines
 so it was really after things things just went sour with him
 and carol i had to wait in line
 and then after things went really sad with him
 and carol tut he started to skate around with me that was what you did you it meant the boys came
 and sort of skated alongside you when i think back
 and he offered me a piece of his that was quite serious that was it that was serious i thought he was probably gon na the next question would be he would be wanting to marry me that wasn't the next question the next question was how far do you live from the that was before he said can i walk you home
 so he had to wait
 and see how far it was
 and was it in his direction or
 and fortunately it was kind of in his direction
 so bill
 and i sort of skated around together went for wee walks you know i was maybe about 14 13 14 at this time went for wee walks on a sunday around caird park
 and scintillating stuff
 and oh i liked i liked he had a lovely little sister i remember there was there was bill
 and then there was this huge gap you know
 and then his mum had this unexpected little baby you know a little girl
 and she i i remember her i just thought she was gorgeous she was like a wee shirley temple only blonde
 and sometimes he used to come with her
 and we would take her to the park
 and
 and stuff like that
 and then we just sort of drifted you know we just drifted away
 but it was certainly the skating that the first boyfriend was was on the cards
 but yeah the skating was really good fun
 and again it was dead safe because we used to come out the skating
 and walk all the way home you know along the kingsway all the way home
 and it was a long way that was quite a long way
 but there was never don't remember any trouble or anybody bein attacked or assaulted or mugged or anything like that you know it was it seemed to be dead safe yeah it was good you liked the skating toon't you yeah yeah
