so i going to take you away back mmhm erm can you think about what your earliest memory is yes my earliest memory would be i was born in 19 44 
so my earliest memory would probably be about 19 47 or 8 when i was 4 year old 
and ehm i had gone to the ponds to get some fish 
and i had a jam jar with some string round it 
and i had a fishing net 
and i had about 15 little minnows in the water 
and i was really really happy 
so i brought it back 
and i was climbing up the stairs to go into the house to show off my catch 
and the a girl who lived above me who sadly was down syndrome 
and 
and was a wee bit aggressive came up the stairs grabbed the jar swung it as hard as she could smashed it against the wall 
and all the fish were in a big puddle on the steps squirming about 
and the just the noise of the glass crashing mmhm 
and then all these little minnows squirming in the pond was just too much for me 
and i evidently ran off you know yellin my head off 
and eh i do know what happened to her 
but then you know she she could really help it was just she was she was right eh sheila her name was 
and that that 1 of my earliest memories mmhm erm that was that when you lived in cragie street cragie street er in the tenement erm a room 
and a kitchen 5 of us in that house well there was 6 
but then my dad died 5 of us in that house my mum 2 brothers 
and a sister 
and myself 
and i was the youngest 
and eh the toilet was on the stair there was no electricity until just before we left that we had gas gas lamps erm 
and we left cragie street in well i was 7 
so that would have been 19 we left cragie street in just it was just before that that they got electric lighting in these houses the outside was lit by gas lamp you know the outside lights mmhm in the street 
and on the stairs the man the came at night 
and put the lights on 
and came in the morning 
and put them off mmhm there was an actual 
and ehm he came with a great big long pole that he would cause the the gas lamps were really high up to keep them away from the kids 
so he came up with a great big long pole 
and i i do know how he did it 
but he just seemed to stick the pole into the glass 
and eh the light either went on or it went off mmhm erm never yet what that pole was all about yeah 
but ehm that was what he did 
so it was a it was a a colourful place live in many ways 
and er how old were you were you how old were you when your dad died i was just er comin up for 2 when my dad died he had some some injuries in the war 
and when he came home from the war he was most unwell 
and he developed tuberculosis 
and there was no cure for tuberculosis in these days 
so he was put into hospital 
and when it became clear that he was goin to die my mum took him out of the hospital we were all sent out of the house because it was 
so contagious tuberculosis 
so we were put away from the house you know ferried out to different people to look after us 
and my mum looked after him 
and then he died 
and the 5 of us stayed on in the house until as i say 19 
and then we were sent out to what to me was the country 
and was a bungalow 
and the council had started to decant people from the central centre of the city out to the housing schemes mmhm ehm which virtually were built in the country certainly for us townies erm we were surrounded by fields ehm in the housing estate that we were sent to is that prefab that was in fintry right erm 
and there was 3 bedrooms there was a bath which was a huge luxury there was a bath 
and a toilet 
and of course the biggest luxury was that it was indoors you know we did have to go out to the toilet erm 
and we had a proper kitchen 
and a 
and a front 
and back door 
and a garden eh 
and that was incredible for for i mean i only had a short experience of my life in a tenement 
but for people who were born 
and bred 
and brought up in tenements all their lives to move out to a council house in the country erm with all these facilities was just amazing 
but 1 of the problems with that was the council were not very because they put people out there 
but there was no infrastructure built the roads were completed 
so there was no transport could come out there there was no shops 
so it meant that people had to walk into town now it was that far it was that far 
but it did mean a hike into town for shopping then they started through time to have some vans come out you know a baker van would come out 
and a butcher van 
and a fish van 
but of course they were expensive er because they you know they had their overheads for their vehicles 
so most people trekked into the town 
and then gradually gradually shops were built as the schemes developed 
and got bigger cause we were in the first street that was ever built in fintry it was called fintry gardens 
and that was the first street of this what is now a huge housing estate erm 
but when the as i say when the first street was built there was there was there was no i mean there was actually no the road was built the houses were built mmhm 
and they were complete 
but there was no road you know 
so it was a kind of a muddy track up to the houses sounds incredible because it all laid out now 
and everything you know you know all the roads are complete 
and there a huge infrastructure now there schools 
and shops 
and you know clinics 
and all those kind of thing there now 
but there was in these days 
but anyway nevertheless i thought i had died 
and gone to heaven because it was just incredible in fact i kept runnin evidently i do remember this 
but evidently i kept runnin through the house it was such a novelty to go in 1 door run through the house 
and out the other door erm it was a huge a huge novelty 
and then like every other novelty it just became you know it just wore off 
and it was just your house 
and that was fine 
but em 
and you were you at school age yeah well there another story wi that my my mum eh i had gone to the school glebelands which was near to cragie street erm 
and 
so when i moved out to the housing scheme my mother i think the next day my mother took me to the window 
and pointed to the wee school that was in the field eh a few fields away there was a wee school in the field 
and she said to me see that that building there 
and i said yeah she said that the school you going to tomorrow 
and of course i did my usual you know i do wan na go to that school because you know i got all my my friends are at glebelands i do wan na go there well you no choice that where you going 
and eh the next day she took me down to the corner of the street 
and 2 girls eh 1 was called ruth gold 
and 1 was called dorothy wright i remember them 
so clearly 
and she said to them you goin down to that school 
and they said yes 
and said well take her with you that true now they would be maybe a year older than me know they bigger than me ehm 
but they took me to the school 
and they took me in to the headmaster 
and said this is the new girl she starting here today 
so he said you know what your name gave him my name 
and he said go along to room 4 
and i just had to walk along the corridor 
and go into room 4 
and the teacher there said eh just come in she looked at the register she was obviously expecting me looked at the register 
and said just sit down there 
and my my worry was that on the blackboard they were doin writing writing 
and 
and she said to to the class now i want you to copy this passage into your jotter 
and she handed me a split new jotter 
and a split new pencil 
and 
and i said oh i sorry 
but i do do that kind of writing 
and she said well you do now that the kind of writing we do here 
so having gone from just you know i do know what you call the the writing scripture to the to the writing was what i it shifted from that in a matter of a morning mm 
and eh 
and then came home 
and was showin off that i could now write in in big people writing mm you know big people that was the way big people wrote 
so that was my that was my jotter 
and i was very pleased with that i was worried to begin with 
but you know i was very pleased with that 
and i loved that school i actually loved that school it was called linlathen primary 
and erm 1 of my teachers ah was a lady called eleanor leith that we of course called miss leith mm 
and eh 
but she told us her name was eleanor 
and erm she i was a bit of a mischief 
but she seemed to like me 
and 1 day i would i had a sore tooth 
and because i mean we did have a dentist or anything god i do think i had a toothbrush in these days never mind a dentist 
but anyway she said what wrong with you eh because i maybe been mumpin 
and sulkin cause i was in pain with this tooth 
and i told her i had a sore tooth 
and she says well get your mummy to take you to the dentist 
and eh 
and i said oh well my mum does have time to do that you see because you know i mean we do know where the dentist is 
and all this nonsense 
so she said well i tell you what she said i take you to a dentist 
and eh at 4 i got to sit in her car that was a huge excitement i got to sit in her car 
and she took me to this dentist down in stobswell we went in we went up the stairs it was up a stair we went up the stair it was a bit scary because i never been in a dentist 
and all the instruments were there 
and everything 
but the great thing was on his on the radio which was in his the surgery bit he had scottish music playing 
and all the time the music was playing he was singing along to it you know i mean it was 
and eh he sat me in the chair 
and gave me a swirl round let us swirl around a wee bit he knew i was frightened 
and miss leith just popped her head in 
and then popped her head out again 
and he did whatever he did to the tooth i do know whether he i do even know whether he pulled it out or whether he filled it that i ca remember 
but he he looked after the the tooth anyway 
and he he gave me a little a little round tin of toothpaste 
and a tiny little brush he just gave it to me to take home he cause he said do you do you brush your teeth often 
and i said no did you not have a have a toothbrush or toothpaste 
so he gave me the toothpaste 
and the toothbrush 
and he said now when you go home you need to brush your teeth in the morning before you go to school 
and at night before you go to bed 
and he said you have very good teeth 
but you want to keep them keep them good do you eat many sweeties 
and i said no because we did we did get sweeties erm 
but for some reason 1 of my tooth had gone a bit my teeth had gone a bit bad 
so that was that 
and it was the next day at school when when miss leith ran me back mm to to where i lived erm by that time now we were in a prefab 
and eh 
so she ran me back to my to the house or or to the street where i lived anyway 
and i jumped out the car 
and eh she said to me did you notice the name on the dentist did you notice the name on the plaque outside 
and i said no i never even noticed the plaque never mind the name 
and eh she said well the name says gordon leith eh dental surgeon 
and gordon leith is my father 
and er i says your father a dentist 
and she said yes she said 
so now i went to that dentist for years after that mmhm you know went every 6 months or whatever it was you know for your 
and eh 
and kept up you know with the dentist for many many years after that until i went to mr butt know that you that you the first dentist i can remember mmhm leith died cause i mean he was a good he was a good age when you know he was quite elderly mmhm when i went with eh that night with miss leith erm 
so he was a good age 
and he died 
and then i did have a dentist for a wee while 
and then i started going to mr butt 
and then he was the dentist after that looked after you folk teeth as well mm 
but erm yeah i loved that school was a great yeah yeah she was a really really nice person miss leith 
and she was really she used to give us all a christmas present everybody got a the whole class got a christmas present it was just a small thing you know maybe a penny dainty or something like that 
but the great thing was that you got called out of the your desk you got you got called out of your seat to come 
and get it mmhm you felt 
so important you know 
and she always kept me till last i was always last cause i i was alphabetically i was last we nobody behind me alphabetically cause i was t for tait mm 
and eh 
and 
and i was always last 
and the anticipation cause it was always in a little brown a little brown paper bag mmhm 
so you did know what what you were gon na get 
and everyone got something a wee bitty different 
and eh oh the anticipation of that was amazing 
and then you would go out 
and she would say something like well i hope you have a very nice christmas 
and em take care on the roads 
and we see you after the after the holiday you know she always said that mmhm every year we had her for 2 3 years i think erm 
so she she sticks in my memory as far as teachers are concerned cause she was 
so kind 
and she was really kind as well to all the naughty ones you know how you know includin myself erm you had these naughty people 
and she she was the 1 as well em when she said i was misbehaving 1 day 
and she said to me em right get out she says i ca remember did now she say outside no yeah she said out 
and i did mean i did know whether she meant the class or the school out of dundee or out of everything 
so i thought well if you stand outside the door 
and the headmaster comes along you get into trouble cause he knows you been put out for being naughty 
so i thought well the only thing to do is go home 
and i went right out the school 
and the thing was i knew that that if i got home once i got home there would be nobody in i i would be stuck because my mum was working olive was at school my brother was home on leave from the army 
but i wasnae very sure about that whether he would be home anyway it was a winter day a dark day 
and when i came up to near the prefab i could see the light on in the bathroom 
so i phew i knew he was in 
so i went in 
and he said to me why are you home you should be at school 
and ehm 
and i first of all said i was sick 
and i was feelin well i was feelin sick 
so that was first of all i thought i try that tack 
and he said to me this is neil 
and he said to me you do look sick 
and i said i got a really sore tummy 
and eventually it came out that i been put out cause i was wantin to ask him whether she meant forever or just 
so he said well if you been naughty i think you probably been told to get out of the classroom not out of the whole school 
and certainly not out of education the education system 
so he said now you know know what you to do 
and i said no he says well you to go right back after lunch time 
and you to stand at her desk 
and when the school bell rings you line up then you go to her you go to the school get into the classroom go to her desk 
and say leith i really sorry for misbehaving this morning 
and i wo do it again 
and 
and i said well no see i ca do that because everybody laugh 
and he says well that why you to do it that why you got to say you really sorry 
and you wo do it again 
and i was going back down the road saying i not doin that i not doing that i just going to sit in the classroom 
and i not saying anything i just gon na go in go to my desk 
and sit down 
and eh i went into the classroom 
and i do know why i did this i do know why i did it to this day 
but i sort of sidled up to the desk 
and she was trying not to look at me she could see me out the corner of her eye 
but she was trying not to look at me eventually she turned round 
and she said yes 
and i said what neil said for me to say with great difficulty 
but 
but i said it 
and she just said 1 word sit 
and 
so i just turned from the desk 
and sat 
but then i was happy because i thought phew i back in again you know i wasnae quite sure how things were gon na go if i was forever mmhm you know how was i gon na learn things or or when could i play in the playground if i was at the school you know 
so i was happy to be back in that school system were quite known for that kind of thing though were you because there was the time in nursery as well when you just sort of went awol mmhm can you tell us about that mmhm well it was actually awol from school because oh see i brought up in the nursery mmhm 
and i was in the nursery when i was months old cause my mum had to go to work 
and there was all these council nurseries where babies were taken in because it was just after the war 
and erm you know things were very very different 
and erm anyway i was brought up in ellengowan nursery every day i went there 
and i was virtually just taken home at night 
and put to bed 
so the nursery was my home the nursery was my was really like my home 
and when i went to school i i went to school the first day went you know was taken in registered 
and everything 
and at when we came out to play i just walked out the school 
and walked back to the nursery which was within walkin distance of the school mmhm i just went right back to the nursery because i thought well it time to go home now i had enough of that 
and then i had evidently appeared at a window they had very low windows in this nursery school the windows were deliberately low you know the the windows actually came down quite low 
so that the the nurses could see out mmhm if the children were playin out 
but i had looked in the window of the matron of the the 
and she was sittin at her desk writing 
and she looked up 
and she said evidently she said to my mum all she could see was this head of blonde curls lookin in the in the window 
and thinkin oh god she back she gone oh god we got her back 
so she she beckoned to me to come in 
so when i went into her room she said to me what are you doing here 
and i said well i just came back because i been to school now 
and it was okay 
but that it 
and she said no no you do come back here audrey you have to stay at school you at school now you do come to nursery school 
and the she phoned the school 
and said you have to send her sister along for her now olive was in a few primaries above me mm you have to send her sister for her 
so olive came for me dragging me along the road cause she was fed up she been taken out of a class that she was really enjoying maybe art or something 
and she had to come 
and collect me 
so she took me back now after that i think i was the start of them locking gates 
and things in cause they didna lock the gate i just walked out of the gate erm 
and i never actually did go back to the nursery school 
but erm i was really sad mmhm you know because it it really was my my life the nursery school it was my home for for all these years 
and the nurses were like mums really you know the nurses the nursery nurses were all because you were taken there like my mum started in the mills at she would probably start at half 7 quarter to 8 
so i be taken there at the back of 7 just after 7 
and then i would be picked up until half 5 quarter to 6 at night 
and then of course you know my mum would be tired 
so i would be taken home 
and bathed or or maybe not even bathed just taken home 
and put to bed really mmhm erm 
so that why it was important that the nursery that why the nursery school was 
so important to me erm 
and what was your granny doing was she also working in the mills mmhm when you were that age mmhm yeah yeah yeah you see there was nobody to look after you because everybody you know my mum sisters 
and brothers were all in the mill 
and they all did a they all did a a different job 
and my my mum was a erm which just is exactly what it says she wound the the flax onto the spools 
and erm there was a 1 of my other aunts was a weaver 
and there was a finisher 
and there was a flattener 
and a there was a sparker 
and oh there was all the different trades mmhm of of em the jute industry 
and they all worked in different parts of it you know my mum said at 1 stage there was a member of the family in every every sector of the mill right at the beginning 
and then because the the flax goes through different processes you know it arrives off the ships from or you know it arrived off the ships from pakistan 
and then it went through various processes 
and my mum reckoned that at 1 stage you know the family had all grown up 
and at 1 stage there was 1 of them in each in each area of the mill erm how many siblings did nanna have well she was the oldest of 13 she had she had 12 brothers 
and sisters mm eh i i i think there was 6 girls 
and 7 boys mmhm 6 girls 
and 7 boys twins eh ehm joseph 
and james they died in infancy they were about 4 months old evidently when they died 
but that was common long ago sadly erm because that was before inoculations 
and that when things were people with that size of a family erm certainly could afford to nourish them all you know they were they would be all i would have thought 
and they lived a very hard life em in a very very small house in the centre of the town near the docks ehm 
and my mum bein the oldest had all the work had a lot of work to do you know besides her besides her job she a lot of ehm work to do in the house with the children 
and ehm it it doesna sound like a great life it was a good life what about your mum dad was he my my mum ca remember yeah he was called joseph 
and he was erm he was a bit of a dead loss really as my mum would put it er because he drank very heavily 
and he worked he worked on the docks he worked he was a what they call a plater 
and that was a skill that that eh was to do with plating was to do with you know puttin the outside pieces on the on the actual ship 
and 
so that what my grandfather did 
but very often he was never at his work cause he could lift his head off the pillow if he was really drunk 
but my granny used to be able to go down 
and get his wages she would go to the docks 
and they knew what my grandfather was like 
and they knew that she had this huge family 
and she used to get his wages just picked up his wages he did touch his wages mmhm erm 
and 
but she said he always got money somewhere for drink she never never yet really knew where he got 
but he always managed to get the money for drink mmhm 
so she had a very hard life extremely hard life 
and yet she was very tough erm very resilient i mean she was in her eighties 
and she was still helpin you know washin nappies for her various you know grandchildren 
and whatever else 
so she was really a bit of a character that the 1 that thought i was a boy was it yes yes she couldnae get round your name cerwyss she could eh she i mean cerwyss that was eh she never heard of it of course 
but then i mean it sounded really like a boy 
so couldnae couldnae cope with that at all 
but erm yeah i think they had a a really really hard time 
and when my mum was expecting me this just gives you an idea of the sort of the culture of the time when my mum was expecting me her her mum who was my gran had gone to the pictures they gone to see a film 
and they were sitting in the pictures 
and my mum you know the her due date was a few weeks away 
so 
but she started to feel really uncomfortable in the pictures 
and she said to my gran i not really not feeling too good 
so my gran said oh well she listened to her saying that for a wee while 
and eventually she said oh come on we walk up the road 
so they started to walk up the road 
and walking up the road was becoming more 
and more uncomfortable for my mum it was that far 
but it was up a hill 
and she was 
and she really was uncomfortable anyway eh they got up to eh the circle round about where my granny lived cause they were goin back to my granny 
and her my mum brothers several of my mum brothers were hangin about on the corner as they did in these days 
so my granny says you better go down for the midwife 
and my my my mum had evidently said oh i do think i needin a midwife she said i think i still got a bit to go yet 
but she said i really uncomfortable 
and my granny said to thomas go 
and get the midwife 
so thomas took to his heels 
and ran down though to find the midwife by which time now i we had got well my mum 
and my gran had got home 
and my mum my gran said to my mum now you better go through 
and lie down cause she had been lookin a bit white 
and poorly 
so she went through to lie down 
and eh i came into the world 
and my gran said the midwife arrived 
and my gran had just said too late you know she the baby born 
so ehm my my gran virtually brought me into the world mmhm hmm 
so that was you know that was that 
and evidently my gran had brought brought quite a few people you know a few of the neighbours erm that had gone into to labour too quick you know the the midwives did get there in time erm my gran thought nothing of it well i mean she had 13 of her own she knew fine she maybe delivered some of them she knew fine what to do 
and 
and 
and 
so on 
so i mean it was quite nice cause she used to tell me years later erm that you know she had brought me into the world 
and fortunately it was quite an easy birth you know there was no complication i sure if there complications then you have to get into hospital 
but most babies in these days were born at home 
and you only went into hospital to have your baby in these days if there was a complication most infants were born at home mmhm 
so my granny certainly brought me into the world erm 
and the was it common em was it common for men to be round no in these days oh no oh no it was common for men to be around when you were born some men did it some men chose to do it 
but it was common 
and i think a lot of it i do even think it was 
so much the men did want to be there the hospital did want them there it was they changed you see that all changed now wi the hospital 
and i think it changed for the better the hospital recognises that mums want the dad there want their husbands there in some cases 
but in in certainly in my mum day oh my god my my my dad well certainly my dad erm was at sea you know he was in the navy 
and he was away with the war eh 
but i would have doubted if he would have been there 
and none of the the boys were allowed in the room you know none of the the brothers or certainly my brothers were allowed into the room erm yeah it was very very different in these days 
but ehm i think i think my mum by the time i came along had probably just had enough babies you know she had brought up practically brought up all her own mmhm siblings 
and then she had 4 4 of her own 
so i think she just well had enough by that time yeah that right that right 
so i mean it was hard it was hard for her there no doubt about it 
but erm yeah it just seems it does seem that long ago 
but yet in some ways it a million from from nowadays you know how things have 
and some things have definitely changed for the better 
but i still think some things were were better in our day in that you know we could we could play in the street there was no cars i mean cars never came along our street cars i was in i was i was in a car until i was about 7 because 
and the only reason i was in a car was because i was a flower girl at our neighbour wedding 
and olive 
and i got to sit in a in a car 
and eh we thought that was amazing 
and i i got gloves that was another amazing thing i got the i mean i did worry when you i was like you when you were little girls you never liked dresses 
and things neither did i 
and the only way i would wear the dress was i had gloves i got to wear these gloves 
and eh i remember my mum sayin to me it ridiculous you know she doesnae like wearin the dress 
but she happy to wear the gloves 
so for some reason we had these little white you know eh 
and i thought i was i was really something in these gloves 
and eh yeah 
so you think do you think it was much safer then for children or do you think it just that you hear more about what goes on now you think it was generally safer i think it was generally safer 
and yet i was taken away from the street 
but we wo go into that 
but i think it was generally safer 
and the reason for that is that an awful lot of the neighbours hung around the street more there was more community spirit i think then erm 
and that might be just because even of the layout of the houses i do know 
but there seemed to in in our street there was a 2 shops on the end of the street you know there was a a greengrocer 
and a grocer like a a 
and a 
and a grocer 
and the the the ladies of the street certainly the elderly ladies of the street used to sit on the shop windowsills 
and you know share their snuff boxes 
and chatter away of an evening you know they were all there was always somebody in the street 
so of course when kids were playing you know if they fell over or they were unwell or they were fighting mmhm something these elderly ladies were unwittingly babysitters mmhm you know cause they say hey stop that or you know they would they would get involved in some fracas if if anything was happening 
and i think that culture has gone i think that culture gone because people are well i do i think i think it might have just been the layout of the buildings 
and everything i not sure 
and the fact that it was eh there was no traffic came along the 
and there was no buses you see in these days it was 
and the came down the main street because of the the cable line yes erm 
so the street really was a a playground the street was the playground erm 
and we had the park we had baxter park 
but then you could go up to baxter park unless somebody took you there you know cause it was a fair wee step for us 
but the boys you know my brothers they they played in the street they played football in the street 
and there was there was shelters round the back eh in our close you know for the war 
and of course they were taken down even after the war finished 
so the best thing in the world was to climb on the top of them erm 
and they would be maybe 9 10 feet high you know they were that high 
but high when you wee 
and of course you were allowed on them there was a big rule mm 
and kids were allowed on the top they were allowed to go in them 
but they were allowed to go on the top of them 
and there were all manner of wee sort of wooden ladders 
and things 
and wee wee sort of wee piles of stones that that would be erected to get you up onto the top 
and they were all hidden round mmhm from the from the windows hidden round the back 
so that your mum if she looked out she couldnae see you climbin onto the shelter 
and you never climbed on a shelter of course that was within sight of your own window everybody went to another shelter 
and there was 1 day that olive 
and i were you know they had got me up onto the i was only about 3 seemingly 
and they got me up onto this shelter 
and eh i mean we were just we just felt we were 
so mischievous 
and we were bein 
so you know on the top of this shelter 
and i can remember actually being a bit wimpy 
and thinkin you know it seemed 
so high once i got up there i thought erm 
and then the next thing was the policeman came through the big pend 
and all we could see was the top of his helmet 
and olive says to me lie flat on your face 
and do say a word 
so i on the top of this shelter 
and ehm little did we know that this guy could just stand on the pile of stones that we got up on 
and then we could see his whole head lookin across 
and all he did he was a great big man 
and all he did was put over his massive hand pluck me off of this shelter 
and you know lift me down 
but dropped me about a foot from the 
so that 
so that i did get down with too much ease 
and eh 
and then he licked his pencil sheafed through his to get to the right page 
and then he said name 
so of course your name went in the policeman book 
and the idea now was the policeman was gon na go to your door mmhm 
and tell your mum you been on the shelters 
so olive 
and i decided we were actually going to have to run away we could not go home because the punishment would fit the crime 
and the crime was bad 
and the punishment would be worse 
so we thought well we just make a run for it 
so we went out the close 
and we got along to the end of the street 
and olive just kept sayin to me just keep followin me just keep followin me 
and then we looked up the street 
and all we could see was my gran comin down albert street bustling as she did you know she always came down as though she was on a mission she came down 
and she shouts to olive you come here 
so of course she seen the 2 of us you see 
so olive goes up what you doin what you doin on the end of the street you werenae supposed to be on the end of the street you see you were all supposed to be on the middle of the street 
so olive said eh oh we just we just lookin for somebody she said well get that meant get meant get home 
so we just turned tail 
and went back 
and we we sort of sat outside for a while thinkin well has he been yet has has he been to the door yet or or will he go after cause we thought well we need to go we need to get some tea sometime we werenae sure whether we should 
and have the tea 
and then get the belting or or we should just not go 
but i i not i mean i got this story in my head 
and i not just sure what happened 
but certainly we never got into trouble 
so i do think the guy ever went near the door i do think the policeman did 
but on sayin that we never went on the shelters again because we just got such a fright that if my mum like if a policeman ever went to your door i mean that was the end of the you can you remember rations mum did you still rations mmhm had right up until we did have ration books in fintry 
so i would imagine i think 19 mmhm or would be the end of the rationing i think 
and that why we never any sweeties because you did get coupons for sweeties 
but you could swap them for coupons for an egg mmhm this kind of thing 
and of course i mean sweeties were were for rich children you know erm 
so we never ever got sweeties i can remember gettin an easter egg when i was quite big when i say that maybe 8 or 9 from my uncle john bought olive 
and i an easter egg 
and i mean you just thought all your birthdays had come together a an easter egg to yourself 
and we were in woolworth 
and the woman went to put mine in a bag you know put it in a bag 
and i did want it in a bag cause i had to show it off i wanted everybody in the world to see this easter egg 
and really show it off that it was mine 
and of course my mum confiscated the easter egg as soon as we got home the easter egg was put into the cupboard 
and we were only allowed a tiny little bit every day 
and she was allowed a tiny little bit of our easter egg every day 
so with the result that easter egg lasted seemed to last forever 
but we just we just 
and i mean you you couldnae steal it you know i mean you couldnae that did occur to us we thought pfff we could go 
and steal a bit more 
but she knew mmhm she knew what stage that easter egg was at 
so you could not steal it 
and eh 
and i reckon i got a theory on this cause i reckon that why we all had good teeth you know we never had a bloomin toothbrush 
but then we never had sweeties 
and we did have biscuits you know we did have a lot of sweet things erm did have really a lot of anything 
but you certainly did have a lot of sweet things erm 
but yeah i got a lot of got a lot of happy memories erm i do have memories sadly of like ever getting on my mum knee or getting a story or i mean we did have any story books or erm i loved i loved goin to the the little story story classes in the library there was little classes where you could primaries 1 2 
and 3 got allowed to go to the library 
and a lady would come 
and read a story to you 
and eh that was great i loved that cause she she this lady would make all the characters come to life you know she would speak like the character did 
and i always thought that was really clever erm because because she became that character in the book you know erm 
but after you came out of primary 3 that was it you know you never got another story in your life again that was the end of the stories 
so i i do have memories of that kind of home life 
but i have i have happy memories of of situations 
and incidents at school 
and outside of home life you know mmhm i have that erm when did you start going skating because that was a thing that mmhm yeah skating i started to go erm when i was probably in 12 right yeah i started goin when i was 12 i started to try 
and learn to skate that was a laugh cause you spent more time on the on the ice than you did on your feet 
but 
but eventually you know after years of years of ploddin on became quite a good skater certainly quite a good speed skater erm used to like to go up at the what they called the ladies speed 
and you know the ladies would go 
and go round as fast as they could 
and then there was the men speed 
and then there was the dancing 
and i did i was good enough for that 
but is that dancing yeah they danced on ice yeah yeah maureen golden i remember maureen golden the first time i ever saw her ever saw her was on the ice 
and it was only after i met up with her years later i said to her i recognise you you used to be an a skater did you 
and she said yeah she had the most beautiful costumes i remember she always had different costumes on 
and she was very very good she was a great skater 
and i used to love watchin it at that time most people just went away 
and had a cup of tea or a drink of juice when the these intervals were on 
but i always stayed i always just liked to watch them 
and a few couples would go 
and do the dancing together mmhm erm it really it really was good 
but erm yeah i liked skating 
and what did you wear when you went to the skating well i got a pair of i thought i was really i was really something i got a pair of wine burgundy corduroy trousers 
and a white jumper 
and that was really trendy in these days that was really trendy 
and i can remember i had a i had a cause cause girls wore skating skirts in these days erm 
and i can remember just not liking it cause i thought it was too long 
and eh i said to olive you know my sister could you could you could you shorten that for me you know mrs said could you could you shorten that for me 
and ehm 
so she starts to pin it up a bitty you see 
and i says no i want it shorter than that i want it shorter than that 
and she was saying erm you ca get it any shorter than that for goodness sake 
and i think it was neil neil came in 
and you know came in on all this nonsense 
and me saying i want it shorter than that 
and eh 
and he said no you do he said it that a good length the way that is just now 
and he said always remember it what people do see that more what they see 
and eh i never 
so anyway i got my skirt at the the decent length mmhm 
and eh 
and that was that 
but we did wear skirts too long or or too you know it was mostly trousers it was mostly trousers cause it was cold you know 
and if you went down wi the on you know you were you were soaking you know 
and the your trousers gave you a wee bitty more protection mmhm 
and it was great fun i loved the skating that where i met my first boyfriend bill heron that where i met him 
but he really fancied my friend he fancied my friend carol raines 
so it was really after things things just went sour with him 
and carol i had to wait in line 
and then after things went really sad with him 
and carol tut erm he started to skate around with me that was what you did you it meant the boys came 
and sort of skated alongside you erm when i think back 
and eh he offered me a piece of his that was quite serious that was it that was serious erm i thought he was probably gon na the next question would be he would be wanting to marry me that was the next question the next question was how far do you live from the that was before he said can i walk you home 
so he had to wait 
and see how far it was 
and was it in his direction or 
and fortunately it was kind of in his direction erm 
so bill 
and i sort of skated around together went for wee walks you know i was maybe about 14 13 14 at this time went for wee walks on a sunday around caird park 
and eh scintillating stuff 
and oh i liked i liked he had a lovely little sister i remember there was there was bill 
and then there was this huge gap you know 
and then his mum had this unexpected little baby you know a little girl 
and she i i remember her i just thought she was gorgeous she was like a wee shirley temple only blonde mm erm 
and sometimes he used to come with her 
and we would take her to the park 
and 
and stuff like that 
and then we just sort of drifted you know we just drifted away 
but it was certainly the skating that the first boyfriend was was on the cards erm 
but yeah the skating was really good fun 
and again it was dead safe because we used to come out the skating 
and walk all the way home you know along the kingsway all the way home 
and it was a long way that was quite a long way 
but there was never do remember any trouble or anybody bein attacked or assaulted or mugged or anything like that you know it was it seemed to be dead safe erm yeah it was good you liked the skating too you yeah yeah
