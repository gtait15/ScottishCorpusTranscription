so you back mm can you think about what your earliest memory is yes yes my earliest memory would be i was born in 1944 
so my earliest memory would probably be about 1947 or 8 when i was 4 year old 
and i had gone to the ponds to get some fish 
and i had a jam jar with some string round it 
and i had a fishing net 
and i had about 15 little minnows in the water 
and i was really really happy 
so i brought it back 
and i was climbing up the stairs to go into the house to show off my catch 
and the a girl who lived above me who sadly was down syndrome 
and 
and was a wee bit aggressive came up the stairs grabbed the jar swung it as hard as she could it against the wall 
and all the fish were in a big puddle on the steps squirming about 
and the just the noise of the glass crashing 
and then all these little minnows squirming in the pond was just too much for me 
and i evidently rang off you know yelling my head off 
and i do know what happened to her then you know she could do the help 
but she was she was she was right sheila name was 
and that that one of my earliest memories of 
and we lived that was in craigie in the tenement a room in the kitchen five of us in that house mother was 6 
but then my dad died five of us in that house my mom two brothers 
and a sister 
and myself 
and i was the youngest 
and the toilet was on the stair there was no electricity until just before we left that we had gas lamps 
and we left craigie in when i was 7 
so that would be 1951 we left cleggie in just it was just before that that they got electric lighting in these houses the outside was lit by gas lamp know the outside lights in the street 
and on the stairs the man the lamplighter came at night 
and put the lights on 
and came in the morning 
and put them off there was a natural lump later 
and he came with a great big long pole that he would cause the gas lamps were really high up to keep them away from the kids 
so he came up with a great big long pole 
and i do know how he did it 
but he just seemed to stick the pole into the glass 
and the light either went on or went off i never get discovered what that poem was all about 
but that was what he did 
so it was it was a a colorful place to live in many ways 
and i have how old were you when your dad died i was just coming up for two when my dad died he had some some injuries in the war 
and when he came home from the war he was most unwell 
and he developed tuberculosis 
and there was no cure for tuberculosis in these days 
so he was put into hospital 
and when it became clear that he was going to die my mum took him out of the we were all sent out of the house because it was 
so contagious tuberculosis 
so we were put away from the house you know ferried out to different people to look after us 
and my mum looked after him 
and then he died 
and the five of us stayed on in the house until as i say 19 51 
and then we were sent out to me was the country 
and was a bungalow 
and the council had started to decant people from the centre of the city out to the housing schemes which virtually were built in the country 
and certainly for us townies we were surrounded by fields in the housing estate that we were sent to 
so no that was infinitely infinitely 
and there was 3 bedrooms there was a bath which was a huge luxury there was a bath 
and the toilet 
and of course the biggest luxury was that it was indoors you know we did have to go out to the toilet 
and we had a proper kitchen 
and a living room 
and a front 
and back door 
and a garden 
and that was incredible for for 
and i only had a short experience of my life in a tenement 
but for people who were born 
and bred 
and brought up in tenements all their lives to move out to a council house in the country with all these facilities was just amazing 
but one of the problems with that was the council were not very long sighted because they put people out there there was no infrastructure built the roads were completed 
so there was no transport could come out there there was no shops 
so it meant that people had to walk into town now it was that far it was that far 
but it did mean hike into town for shopping then the started through time to have some vans come you know a baker van would come out 
and a butcher van 
and a fish van 
but of course they were expensive because they you know they had their overheads for their vehicles 
so most people trekked into the town 
and then gradually gradually shops were built as the schemes developed 
and got because we were in the 1st that was ever built in finchley it called finch gardens 
and that was the 1st of this is now a huge housing estate 
but when the say when the first steep was built there was there was no there was no i mean there was actually no road was the houses were built 
and they were complete 
but there was no rd you know 
so it was a kind of a muddy track up to the house sounds incredible because it all laid out now 
and everything you know everything you know all the roads are complete 
and there a huge neither schools 
and shops 
and you know clinics 
and all this kind of thing there now 
but there was in these days 
but anyway nevertheless i thought i died 
and gone to heaven because it was just incredible in fact i kept evidently i do remember this 
but evidently i kept running through the house it was such a novelty to go in one door run through the house 
and out the other door it was a huge huge novelty 
and then like every other novelty it just became you know it just wore off 
and it was just your house 
and that was fine 
but were you at school yeah well there another story with that my my mum i had gone to the school gloucester craigie 
and 
so when i moved out to the housing scheme my mother i think the next day my mother took me to the window 
and pointed to the wee school that was in the field a few fields away there was a wee school in the field 
and she said to me see that that building there 
and i see josh is that the school you going to tomorrow 
and of course i my usual you know i do want to go to that school because you know i got all my friends are at cleveland do want to go there oh well you have no choice that where you going 
and the next day she took me down to the corner of the street 
and two girls one was called ruth gold 
and one was called dorothy wright 
and i remember them 
so clearly 
and she said to them you going down to that school 
and they said yes 
and said well take her with you that true now there would be maybe a year older than you know they bigger than me 
but they took me to the school 
and they took me into the headmaster 
and said this is the new girl starting here today 
so he said know what your gave him a name 
and he said go along to room 4 
and i just had to walk along the corridor 
and go into room 4 
and the teacher there said just come in she looked at the register was obviously expecting me looked at the register 
and said just sit down there 
and my worry was that on blackboard they were doing joined up writing joint operator 
and she said to the now i want you to copy this passage into your daughter 
and you handed me a split new daughter 
and a split new pencil 
and 
and i said i sorry 
but i do do that kind of writing 
and she said well you do now that the kind of writing we do here 
so having gone from just you know i do know what you call the not joint the unjoined writing to the joint operating shifted from that in a matter of a morning 
and 
and then came home 
and was showing off that i could now write in in big peoples rating you know big people that is the way big people wrote 
so that was my that was my job 
and i was very pleased with i was worried to begin with 
but yeah i was very pleased with that 
and i loved that school actually loved that it called lin lathan primary 
and one of my teachers i was a lady called eleanor leith that we of course called miss leath 
and 
but she told us her name was eleanor 
and she i was a bit of a mischief 
but she seemed to like me 
and one day i had a sore tooth 
and because we did have a dentist or anything god i do think i had a toothbrush in these days made a dentist 
but anyway she said what wrong with you i maybe been mumping 
and sulking because i was in pain with this tooth 
and had told her i had a sore tooth 
and she says well get your mummy to take you to the dentist 
and 
and i saw well my my mum does have time to do that you see because you know i mean we do know where the dentist is 
and all this nonsense she well i tell you what she said i take you to a dentist 
and at i got to sit in her that was a huge excitement i got to sit in her car 
and she took me to this dentist down in stobswell we went in went up the stairs was up a stair up the it was a bit scary because i never been in a dentist 
and all the instruments were there 
and everything 
but the great thing was on his on the radio which was in his the surgery bit he had scottish music playing 
and all the time the music was playing he was singing along to it you know i mean it was amazing 
and he sat me in the chair 
and gave me a swirl around let it swirl around a wee he knew i was frightened 
and miss leith just popped her head in 
and then popped her head out again 
and he did whatever he did to the tooth i do know whether he i do even know whether he pulled it out or whether he filled it that i ca remember 
but he looked after the tooth anyway 
and he gave me a little round 10 of toothpaste 
and a tiny little brush he just gave it to me to take home 
and he said because he said you brush your teeth 
and i said no i did have a toothbrush or toothpaste 
so he gave me the toothpaste 
and the toothbrush 
and he said now when you go home you need to brush teeth in the morning before we go to school 
and at night before you go to bed 
and he said you have very good teeth 
but you want to keep them keep them good you eat many sweeties 
and i said no because we did we did get sweeties 
but for some reason one of my tooth had gone a bit 
but my teeth had gone a bit 
so that was that 
and it was the next day at school 
and miss leath ran me back to where i was i lived by that now we were in a prefab 
and 
so she ran me back to my to the house or or to the street where i lived anyway 
and i jumped out the car 
and she said to me did you notice the name on the dent ist did you notice the name on the plaque outside 
and i said no 
and i noticed the black never mind the name 
and she said well the name says gordon s leith dental surgeon 
and gordon leith is my father 
and i says ah your father a dentist 
and she said yes 
so now i went to that dentist for years after that you know went every six months or whatever it was you know for your checkups 
and 
and kept up you know with the dentist for many many years after that until i went to you know that you that you went to buses sticking it in leith died because he was a he was a good age when you know he was quite elderly when i went with that night with miss leath 
so he was a good agent he died 
and then i did have a dentist for a wee while 
and then i started going to 
and then he was the life long dentist after that looked after you folks teeth as well 
but yeah i loved that school was a great school it like yeah yeah she was a really really nice person mislead 
and she was really she used to give us all a christmas present everybody got the whole class got a christmas present now it was just a small thing you know maybe a penny dainty or something like that 
but the great thing was that you got called out your desk you got you got caught out of your seat to come 
and get it 
and you felt 
so important you know 
and she always me to last i was always the last because i i was alphabetically i was last with nobody behind me alphabetically because i was tea for tate 
and 
and i was always last 
and the anticipation because it was always in a little brown a little brown paper bag 
so you did know what what you were going to get 
and everybody got something everybody different 
and oh anticipation of that 
and then you would go out 
and you see something like well i hope you have a very nice christmas 
and we take care on the roads 
and i will see you after the after the holiday know she always said that every year we had her for years i think 
so she she sticks in my memories as far as teachers are concerned because she was 
so kind 
and she was really kind as well to all the naughty ones you know how you know including myself you had these naughty people 
and she she was the one as well um when she said i was misbehaving one day 
and she said to me get hsi ca did know she here outside no she said out 
and i did mean i did know whether she meant out the class or out the school out of dundee or out of everything 
so i thought well if you stand outside the door 
and the headmaster comes along you get into trouble because he knows you been put out for being naughty 
so i thought well the only thing to do is go home 
and i went right out of school 
and the thing was i knew that that if i got home once i got home there would be nobody in that i would be stuck because my mum was working all of us at school my brother was home on leave from army 
but i was very sure about that whether he would be home it was a winter day a dark day 
and when i came up to near the prefab i could see the light on in the bathroom 
so i knew i knew he was in 
so i went in 
and he said to me why you home you should be at school 
and i first of all said i was 
and i was feeling i was feeling sick 
so that first of all i thought try that tack to me this is neil 
and he said to me you do look sick 
and i saw do he got really sore tummy 
and eventually it came out that i been put out because i was wanting to ask him whether she meant i forever or just out 
so he well if you been naughty i think you probably been told to get out of the classroom not out of the whole school school 
and certainly not out of education the education system 
so you say no you do know what you have to 
and i said no he says well you have to go right back after lunchtime 
and you have to stand at our desk 
and the school bell rings line up then you go to her you get into school get into the classroom go to our desk 
and say miss leith i really sorry for misbehaving this morning 
and i wo do it again 
and then i said well no see i ca do that because everybody laugh 
and he says well that why you have to do it that why you got to say you really sorry 
and you wo do it again 
and i was going back down the road saying i not doing that i not doing that i just going to sit in the classroom 
and i not saying anything i just going to go in go to my desk 
and sit down 
and i went into the classroom 
and i do know why i did this i do know why i did it to this day 
but i sort of sidled up to the desk 
and she was trying not to look at me could see me at the corner of her eye was trying not to look at me eventually she turned round 
and she said yes 
and i said what neil said for me to say with great difficulty 
but 
but i said it 
and she just said one word sit 
so i just turned from the desk 
and 
but then i was happy because i thought i back in again you know i was quite sure how things were going to go if i was out forever you how was it going to learn things or or when could i play in the playground if i was the you know 
so i was happy to be back in that school system again quite known for that kind of 
so were you because there was the time at nursery as well that you just sort of might be able to uh huh uh well i was actually able from school because you see i was brought up in the nursery 
and i was in the nursery when i was months old because my mom had to go to work 
and there was all these council nurseries where babies were taken in because it was just after the war 
and you know things were very very different 
and anyway i was brought up in ellen gown nursery every day i went there 
and i was virtually just taken home at night 
and put to bed 
so the nursery was my home the nursery was my was really like my home 
and when i went to school i went to school the first day when you know was taken in registered 
and everything 
and at play time when we came out to play i just walked out the school 
and walked back to the nursery which was within walking distance of the school i just went right back to the nursery because i thought well it time to go home now 
and then i evidently appeared at a window that very low windows in this nursery school the windows were deliberately low you know the windows actually came down quite 
so that the nurses could see out if the children were playing out 
but i had looked in the window of the matron of the the nursery school 
and she was sitting at her desk writing 
and she looked up 
and she said evidently she said to my mum all she could see was this hid a blonde curls looking in the window 
and thinking oh god she back she oh god we got her back 
so she beckoned to me to come in now i went into her she said to me what are you doing here 
and i said well i just came back because i been to school now 
and it was okay 
but that it 
and she said no no you do come back here oggy you have to stay at school you at school you do come to nursery school 
and she phoned the school 
and said you have to send her sister along for an olive was in a few primaries above me you have to send her sister for 
so olive came for me dragging me on the road because she was fed up she been taken out of a class that she was really enjoying art or 
and she had to come 
and collect me 
so she took me back now after that i think i was the start of the locking gates 
and things in schools because then the lock the gate i just walked out of the gate 
and i never actually did go back to the nursery school 
but i was really sad you know because it it really was my my life the nursery it was my home for for all these years 
and the nurses were like mums really you know the nurses we all because you were taken there like my mum started in the mills at she would probably start at half seven 
so i be taking it at the back of seven just after 
and then i would be picked up until half five quarter to at night 
and then of course you know my mum would be tired 
so it would be taken home 
and bathed or or maybe not even bath just taken home 
and put to bed really 
so that why it was important that the nursery that why the nursery school was 
so important to me what was here doing machine also working the mins yeah yeah you see there was no detail look after you because everybody you know my mum sisters 
and brothers what all in the mill 
and the older the older a different job 
and my my mum was a spool winder which just is exactly what it says you wound the flax onto the 
and there was a that when my mother asked was a weaver 
and there was a finisher 
and there was a flattener 
and there was a sparker 
and oh there was all the different trades of of the jew industry 
and all worked in different parts of it you know my mum said at one stage there was a member of the family in every every sector of the mill right at the beginning 
and then because the flax goes through different processes you know it arrives off the ships from packet or arrived off the ships from pakistan 
and then it went through various processes 
and my mum reckoned at one stage you know the family had all grown up 
and at one stage there was one of them in each in each area of the mill um siblings did well she was the oldest of 13 chad chad chad 12 brothers 
and sisters i thought there was 6 girls 
and seven boys 6 girls 
and seven boys twins joseph 
and james they died in they were about four months old evidently when they died 
but that was common long ago sadly because that was before inoculations 
and that when things where people with that size of a family certainly could afford to nourish them all know they would they would be all well nourished i would 
and they lived a very hard life in a very very small house in the centre of the town near the docks 
and my mum being the oldest had all the work had a lot of work to do you know besides her besides her job she had a lot of work to do in the house with the children 
and it does sound like a great life at all it was a good life at your mum dad was he my mum dad yeah he was called joseph 
and he was he was a bit of a a dead horse through the years my mum would put it because he drank very heavily 
and he worked he worked on the docks he worked was a what they call a plater 
and that was a skill that that was to do with ship building plating was to do with you know putting the outside pieces on the on the actual ship 
and 
so that when my grandfather did 
but very often he was never at his work because he could lift his head off the pillow if he was really drunk 
but magrani used to be able to go down 
and get his wages yeah she would go to the docks 
and they knew what my grandfather was like 
and they knew that she had this huge family 
and she used to get just picked up his wages he did touch his wages 
and 
but said he always got money somewhere for she never never yet really knew where he got it from 
but he always managed to get money for drink 
so she had a very hard life extremely hard life 
and yet she was very tough very resilient means she was in her 80s 
and she was still helping you know washing nappies for her various you know grandchildren 
and whatever else 
so she was really a bit of a character that yes yes she could get round your name kenneth she could she mean kerris that she never heard of it of course 
but then it sounded really like a boy 
so she could could cope with that at all 
but yeah i think i had a really really hard time 
and when my mum was expecting this just gives you an idea the culture at the time when my mum was expecting me mum her mum was my gran had gone to the pictures had gone to see a film 
and they were sitting in the pictures 
and my mum you know the her due date was a few weeks away 
so 
but she started to feel uncomfortable in the pictures 
and she said to my grana not really not feeling too good 
so my well she listened to her saying that if we found eventually she all come on we walk up the road 
so they started to walk up the road 
and walking up the road was becoming more 
and more uncomfortable for my mum it was that far 
but it was up a hill 
and she was 
and she really was uncomfortable anyway they got up to the circle round about where my granny lived because we were going back to my 
and her my mum brothers several of my mum brothers were hanging about on the corner as they did in these days 
so my granny says you better go down for the midwife 
and my mumma definitely said i do think i needing a midwife i think i still got a bit to go yet 
but i really uncomfortable my granny said to thomas go 
and get the midwife thomas took t seals 
and ran down through mccrady to find the midwife by which time now we had got where my mum 
and my gran had got home 
and my gran said to my mumma you better go through 
and lie down because she had been looking a bit white 
and poorly 
so she went through to lie down 
and i came into the world 
and my gran said the midwife arrived 
and my granddaughter said too late know she the baby born 
so my grand virtually brought me into 
so that was you know that was that quite a few people you know a few of the neighbors that had gone into to labour too quick you know the midwives did get there in time my gran thought nothing of it that means you had 13 of her own she knew then she knew delivered some of she knew fine what to do 
and 
so on 
so i mean it was quite nice because she used to tell me years later that you know she had brought me into the world 
and fortunately it was quite an easy birth you know there was no complication i sure if there complications then you have to get into hospital 
but most babies in these days were born at home 
and you only went to hospital to have your baby in these days if there was a complication most infants were born at home 
so my granny certainly brought me into the world 
and was it common in was it coming for men to be round no oh no oh no it was common for men to be around when you were born kennis some men did it some men chose to do it 
but it was common 
and i think a lot of it do even think it was 
so much the men did want to be there the hosp did want them there it they changed you see that all changed now with hospital 
and i think it changed for the better the hospital recognizes that mums want the dad there want their husbands there in some cases 
but in in certainly in my mums my god my my my dad well certainly my dad was at you know he was in the navy 
and he was away with the war 
but i would have doubted if he would have been there 
and none of the boys were allowed in the room you know none of the brothers or or certainly my brothers were allowed into the room yeah it was very very different in these days 
but i think i think my mum by the time i came along had probably just had enough babies you know should have brought practically brought up all her own siblings 
and then she had of her own i think she just well had enough by that time 
and that right that right 
so i mean it was it was hard for her there no doubt about it 
but yeah it just seems it seemed that long ago 
but 
and yet in some ways it a million light years from from nowadays know how things have changed 
and 
and some things have definitely changed for the better 
but i still think some things were were better in our day in that you know we could we could play in the street there no i mean cars never came along our street cars i was was it was in a car until i was about because 
and the only reason i was in a car was because i was a float guy at our next door neighbour wedding 
and olive 
and i got to sit in a in a car 
and we thought that was amazing 
and i i got gloves that was another amazing thing i got i mean i did worry i was like you 
and you were little cares never liked dresses 
and things neither did i 
and the only way i would wear the dress was i had gloves i got to wear these gloves 
and i remember my mum saying i mean it ridiculous you know she does like wearing a dress 
but she happy to wear the gloves 
so for some reason we had these little white you know wrist gloves 
and i thought it was i was really something in these gloves 
and yeah 
so you think do you think it much safer then for children or do you think it just that we hear more about what goes on i think it was generally safer 
and yet i was to hear away from the street 
but we would go into 
but i think it was generally safer 
and the reason for that is that an awful lot of the neighbors hung around the street there was more there was more community spirit i think then 
and that might be just because even if the layout of the houses i do know 
but there seemed to in our street there was a 2 shops on the end of the street you know there was grocer 
and a grocer like a fruit shop 
and a 
so 
and the the the ladies of the street certainly the elderly ladies of the street used to sit on the short window sills 
and you know share their snuff boxes 
and chatter away of an evening know they were all there was always somebody in the street 
so of course when kids were playing you know the fell over or they were unwell or they were fighting something these elderly ladies were unwittingly babysitters you know because they say hey stop that or you know they they would get involved in some fracas if if anything was happening 
and i think that culture has gone i think that cultures gone because people are well i think i think it might have just been the layout of the buildings 
and everything not sure 
and the fact that it was there was no traffic came along the street 
and there was no buses you see in these days it was tram cars 
and the tram cars down the main street because of the cable line 
so the street really was a playground the street was the playground 
and we had we had baxter park 
but then you could walk to baxter park unless somebody took you there you know because it was a fairly step for us 
but the boys you know my brothers they they played in the street they played football on the street 
and there was air rage there was air raid shelters around the back in our clothes you know foot for the war 
and of course they were taken down even after the war finished 
so the best thing in the world was to climb on the top of them 
and there would be maybe 910 feet you know they were that high 
but high when you wee of course you were allowed on them there was a big rule 
and kids were allowed on the like to go in them 
but they were allowed to go on the top of them 
and they were all manner of ways of wooden ladders 
and things 
and we we sort of piles of stones that that would be erected to get you up onto the they were all hidden around from the from the windows hidden around the back 
so that your mum if she looked out she could see climbing onto the shed you never climbed on a shelter of course that was within sight of your own window everybody went to another shell 
and there was one day that oliver knee where you know they got me up onto the shabs about 3 seemingly 
and they got me up onto this shelter 
and i mean we were just we just felt we were 
so mischievous 
and being 
so dared devilish you know on the top of the shelter 
and i can remember actually being a bit wimpy 
and thinking you know seemed 
so high once 
and then the next thing was the policeman came through the big bend 
and all because he was the top of his helmet 
and all of his estimate lie flat on your face 
and do say a word 
so i spread eagle down the top of this shelter 
and little did we know that this guy could just stand on the pile of stones that we got up on 
and then we could see his whole head looking across 
and all he did was great big man 
and he did was put over these massive hand pluck me off of 
and you know lift me down 
but drop me about a foot from the bombs 
so that it did get down with too much ease 
and any licked his pencil shift through his notebook to get to the right page 
and then he said name 
so of course your name meant in the policeman book 
and the idea now was the policeman going to to your door 
and tell your mum you been on the shelters 
so all of a sudden i decided we were actually going to have to run away we could not go home because the punishment would fit the crime 
and the crime was bad 
and the punishment would be worse 
so we thought well we just make a run for it 
so we went out the close 
and we got along to the end of the street 
and olive just kept saying to me just keep following me just keep following me 
and then we looked up the street 
and all of a sudden see was my gran coming down albert bustling a shoulder she always came down 
so she was on a mission she came down 
and she shouted 
so of course she seemed to do this you see 
so olive goes up are you doing what are you doing on the end of the street one is supposed to be on the end of the you supposed to be in the middle of the street 
so olive said we just we just looking for somebody she well get 
and that meant get meant get home 
so we just did tail 
and went back 
and we were sort of sat outside for a while thinking well has he been yet has he been to the door yet or or will he go after because we thought well we need to we need to get some tea sometime 
so we unsure whether we should go 
and have the tea 
and then get the belting or i would just not go 
but i not i mean i got this story in my head 
and i not just sure what happened 
but certainly we never got into trouble 
so i do think the guy ever went near the door do think the policeman did 
but on saying that we never went on the shelters again because we just got such afraid that if my mum i give a policeman went to your door i mean that was the end of the world you know can you remember russian name hydration books right up until we did have rashing books in fintry 
so we imagine i think 1948 or 4849 would be the end of the rationing i think 
and that why i would never any sweeties because you did get coupons for sweeties 
but you could swap them for coupons for an egg this kind of thing of course my main sweeties were were for rich children you know 
so we never ever got sweeties i can remember getting an easter egg when i was quite big when i say that maybe 8 or 9 from uncle john 
but oliver 9 easter egg 
and ah i mean you just thought all your birthdays come together an easter egg to yourself 
and morning woolworths 
and the woman went to put mine in a bag you know put it in a bag 
and i did want in a bag because i had to show off i wanted everybody in the world to see this easter egg i really show off that it was mine 
and of course my mum confiscated the easter egg as soon as we got home the easter egg was put into the cupboard 
and we were only allowed a tiny little bit every day 
and she was allowed a tiny little bit of our easter egg every day 
so with the result that easter egg lasted seemed to last forever 
but we just we just any mean you could steal it know you could mean that did occur to us without we could go 
and steal a bit more 
but she knew she knew was data easter eggs 
so you could not steal it 
and 
and i reckon i got a theory on this because i reckon that why we all had good teeth you know we never had a blind toothbrush 
but then we never had sweeties 
and we did have biscuits you know you did have a lot of sweet things did have really a lot of anything 
but you certainly did have a lot of sweet things 
but you have got a love got a lot of happy memories i do have memories sadly of like ever getting on my mum knee or getting a story or not have any story books or i loved i loved going to the the little storey storey in the library there a little storytelling classes where you could primaries 
and three got allowed to go to the library 
and a lady would come 
and read a story to you 
and that was great i loved that because this lady would make all the characters come to life 
and she would speak like the character did now 
so that was really clever because because she became that character in the book you know 
but after you came out of primary three that was it know you never got another story in your life that was the end of stories 
so i do have memories of that kind of home life 
but i have have happy memories of situations 
and incidents at school 
and outside of home life you know i love that when did you start going skating that the thing that like yeah skating i started to go when i was probably in secondary school yeah started going when i was started to try 
and learn to skate 
and that was a laugh because you know you spent more time on the on the ice than you did on your feet 
but 
but eventually you know after years of years of playing on became quite a good skater certainly quite a good speed skater peter used to like to go up at the what they call the lady speed 
and you know the ladies would go 
and go around as fast as they could 
and then there was the men speed then there was the dancing 
and i did was good enough for that 
but yeah they danced on ice yeah maureen golden i remember maureen golden the first time i ever saw her ever saw her was on the ice 
and it was only after he met up with her years later i said to her i recognise you you used to be a nice a dance iced dance skate did 
and she said yes she had the most beautiful i remember she always had different costumes on 
and she was very very good chief secretary ice dan skater 
and i still have watching it at that most people just went away 
and had a cup of tea or a drink of juice when the 
but on 
but i always did was just like to the a few couples would go 
and do the dancing together it really it really was good 
but yeah we like skating the skating well i got i thought i was really really something i got a pair of wine burgundy corduroy trousers 
and a white polo neck jumper 
and that was a really trendy in these days really trendy 
and then i ca remember i had a skating skirt i had a skating skirt because girls wore skating skirts in these days 
and i can remember just not liking it because i thought it was too long 
and i said to olive you know sister could you could you could you shorten that for me you know ca do anything for herself said could you shorten that for me 
and 
so she starts to pin up a bit you see 
and i want it shorter than that it shorter than that 
and she was seeing you could get it any shorter than now for goodness sake 
and i think it was neil neil 
and you know came in 
and all this nonsense 
and me saying i did know 
and 
and he said no you do he said it that a good length away that is just now he said always remember it what people do see it more interesting not what they see 
and i never forgotten that 
so anyway i got my skirt that the the decent length 
and that was that 
but we did wear skirts too long 
and then or or too you know it was mostly it was mostly trousers because it was cold you know 
and if you went down were the skating skirt on know you were you soaking you know in a your trousers give you a wee bit more protection 
and it was great fun i loved guess where i met my first boyfriend bill bill heron i swear i met him 
but he really fancied my friend he fancied my friend carol raines 
so it was really after things things just went sideways in cairo i had to wait in line 
and then after things went really sad with him 
and carol he started to skate around with me that was what you you the meant the boys came 
and sort of skated alongside you when i think back 
and he offered me a piece of his chewing gum that was quite serious that was it i thought he was probably the next question would be would be wanting to marry me that was the next question the next question was how far do you live from the ice rink that was before he said i walk you home 
so you had to wait 
and see how far it was 
and was in his direction now 
and fortunately it was kind of indiana his direction 
and saw beline sort of skated around together went for wee walks you know maybe about at this time went for wee walks on a sunday around cape park 
and scintillating stuff 
and i i like i liked he had a lovely little sister i remember there was there was bill 
and then there was this huge gap you know 
and then his mum had this unexpected little baby you know a little girl 
and she i i remember 
and i just thought she was gorgeous like it was shirley temple only blonde 
and sometimes he used to come with her 
and we would take her to the park 
and 
and stuff like that 
and then we just sort of drifted you know it was drifted away 
but certainly the skating that the first boyfriend was was on the cards yeah skating was really good fun 
and again it was dead safe because we used to come out the skating 
and walk all the way home you know along the kingsway all the way home was a long way that was quite a long way 
but there was never any trouble or anybody being in attacked or assaulted or mugged or anything like that know it was it seemed to be dead safe yeah it was good you liked skating too did you yeah yeah yeah
