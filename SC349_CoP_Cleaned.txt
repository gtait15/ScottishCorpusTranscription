 so you back can you think about what your earliest memory is yes yes my earliest memory would be i was born in 1944
 so my earliest memory would probably be about 1947 or 8 when i was 4 year old
 and i had gone to the ponds to get some fish
 and i had a jam jar with some string round it
 and i had a fishing net
 and i had about 15 little minnows in the water
 and i was really really happy
 so i brought it back
 and i was climbing up the stairs to go into the house to show off my catch
 and the a girl who lived above me who sadly was down syndrome
 and
 and was a wee bit aggressive came up the stairs grabbed the jar swung it as hard as she could it against the wall
 and all the fish were in a big puddle on the steps squirming about
 and the just the noise of the glass crashing
 and then all these little minnows squirming in the pond was just too much for me
 and i evidently rang off you know yelling my head off
 and i don't know what happened to her then you know she couldn't do the help
 but she was she wasn't she wasn't right sheila name was
 and that's that's 1 of my earliest memories of
 and we lived that was in craigie in the tenement a room in the kitchen 5 of us in that house mother was 6
 but then my dad died 5 of us in that house my mom 2 brothers
 and a sister
 and myself
 and i was the youngest
 and the toilet was on the stair there was no electricity until just before we left that we had gas lamps
 and we left craigie in when i was 7
 so that would be 1951 we left cleggie in just it was just before that that they got electric lighting in these houses the outside was lit by gas lamp know the outside lights in the street
 and on the stairs the man the lamplighter came at night
 and put the lights on
 and came in the morning
 and put them off there was a natural lump later
 and he came with a great big long pole that he would cause the gas lamps were really high up to keep them away from the kids
 so he came up with a great big long pole
 and i don't know how he did it
 but he just seemed to stick the pole into the glass
 and the light either went on or went off i've never get discovered what that poem was all about
 but that was what he did
 so it was it was a a colorful place to live in many ways
 and i haven't how old were you when your dad died i was just coming up for 2 when my dad died he had some some injuries in the war
 and when he came home from the war he was most unwell
 and he developed tuberculosis
 and there was no cure for tuberculosis in these days
 so he was put into hospital
 and when it became clear that he was going to die my mum took him out of the we were all sent out of the house because it was
 so contagious tuberculosis
 so we were put away from the house you know ferried out to different people to look after us
 and my mum looked after him
 and then he died
 and the 5 of us stayed on in the house until as i say 19 51
 and then we were sent out to me was the country
 and was a bungalow
 and the council had started to decant people from the centre of the city out to the housing schemes which virtually were built in the country
 and certainly for us townies we were surrounded by fields in the housing estate that we were sent to
 so no that was infinitely infinitely
 and there was 3 bedrooms there was a bath which was a huge luxury there was a bath
 and the toilet
 and of course the biggest luxury was that it was indoors you know we didn't have to go out to the toilet
 and we had a proper kitchen
 and a living room
 and a front
 and back door
 and a garden
 and that was incredible for for
 and i only had a short experience of my life in a tenement
 but for people who were born
 and bred
 and brought up in tenements all their lives to move out to a council house in the country with all these facilities was just amazing
 but 1 of the problems with that was the council were not very long sighted because they put people out there there was no infrastructure built the roads weren't completed
 so there was no transport could come out there there was no shops
 so it meant that people had to walk into town now it wasn't that far it wasn't that far
 but it did mean hike into town for shopping then the started through time to have some vans come you know a baker van would come out
 and a butcher van
 and a fish van
 but of course they were expensive because they you know they had their overheads for their vehicles
 so most people trekked into the town
 and then gradually gradually shops were built as the schemes developed
 and got because we were in the 1st that was ever built in finchley it's called finch gardens
 and that was the 1st of this is now a huge housing estate
 but when the say when the first steep was built there was there was no there was no i mean there was actually no road wasn't the houses were built
 and they were complete
 but there was no rd you know
 so it was a kind of a muddy track up to the house sounds incredible because it's all laid out now
 and everything you know everything you know all the roads are complete
 and there's a huge neither schools
 and shops
 and you know clinics
 and all this kind of thing there now
 but there wasn't in these days
 but anyway nevertheless i thought i'd died
 and gone to heaven because it was just incredible in fact i kept evidently i don't remember this
 but evidently i kept running through the house it was such a novelty to go in 1 door run through the house
 and out the other door it was a huge huge novelty
 and then like every other novelty it just became you know it just wore off
 and it was just your house
 and that was fine
 but were you at school yeah well there's another story with that my my mum i had gone to the school gloucester craigie
 and
 so when i moved out to the housing scheme my mother i think the next day my mother took me to the window
 and pointed to the wee school that was in the field a few fields away there was a wee school in the field
 and she said to me see that that building there
 and i see josh is that's the school you're going to tomorrow
 and of course i my usual you know i don't want to go to that school because you know i've got all my friends are at cleveland don't want to go there oh well you have no choice that's where you're going
 and the next day she took me down to the corner of the street
 and 2 girls 1 was called ruth gold
 and 1 was called dorothy wright
 and i remember them
 so clearly
 and she said to them you going down to that school
 and they said yes
 and said well take her with you that's true now there would be maybe a year older than you know they're bigger than me
 but they took me to the school
 and they took me into the headmaster
 and said this is the new girl starting here today
 so he said know what's your gave him a name
 and he said go along to room 4
 and i just had to walk along the corridor
 and go into room 4
 and the teacher there said just come in she looked at the register was obviously expecting me looked at the register
 and said just sit down there
 and my worry was that on blackboard they were doing joined up writing joint operator
 and she said to the now i want you to copy this passage into your daughter
 and you handed me a split new daughter
 and a split new pencil
 and
 and i said i'm sorry
 but i don't do that kind of writing
 and she said well you do now that's the kind of writing we do here
 so having gone from just you know i don't know what you call the not joint the unjoined writing to the joint operating shifted from that in a matter of a morning
 and
 and then came home
 and was showing off that i could now write in in big peoples rating you know big people that is the way big people wrote
 so that was my that was my job
 and i was very pleased with i was worried to begin with
 but yeah i was very pleased with that
 and i loved that school actually loved that it's called lin lathan primary
 and 1 of my teachers i was a lady called eleanor leith that we of course called miss leath
 and
 but she told us her name was eleanor
 and she i was a bit of a mischief
 but she seemed to like me
 and 1 day i had a sore tooth
 and because we didn't have a dentist or anything god i don't think i had a toothbrush in these days made a dentist
 but anyway she said what's wrong with you'cause i'd maybe been mumping
 and sulking because i was in pain with this tooth
 and had told her i had a sore tooth
 and she says well get your mummy to take you to the dentist
 and
 and i saw well my my mum doesn't have time to do that you see because you know i mean we don't know where the dentist is
 and all this nonsense she well i'll tell you what she said i'll take you to a dentist
 and at i got to sit in her that was a huge excitement i got to sit in her car
 and she took me to this dentist down in stobswell we went in went up the stairs was up a stair up the it was a bit scary because i'd never been in a dentist
 and all the instruments were there
 and everything
 but the great thing was on his on the radio which was in his the surgery bit he had scottish music playing
 and all the time the music was playing he was singing along to it you know i mean it was amazing
 and he sat me in the chair
 and gave me a swirl around let it swirl around a wee he knew i was frightened
 and miss leith just popped her head in
 and then popped her head out again
 and he did whatever he did to the tooth i don't know whether he i don't even know whether he pulled it out or whether he filled it that i can't remember
 but he looked after the tooth anyway
 and he gave me a little round 10 of toothpaste
 and a tiny little brush he just gave it to me to take home
 and he said because he said you brush your teeth
 and i said no i didn't have a toothbrush or toothpaste
 so he gave me the toothpaste
 and the toothbrush
 and he said now when you go home you need to brush teeth in the morning before we go to school
 and at night before you go to bed
 and he said you have very good teeth
 but you want to keep them keep them good you eat many sweeties
 and i said no because we didn't we didn't get sweeties
 but for some reason 1 of my tooth had gone a bit
 but my teeth had gone a bit
 so that was that
 and it was the next day at school
 and miss leath ran me back to where i was i lived by that now we were in a prefab
 and
 so she ran me back to my to the house or or to the street where i lived anyway
 and i jumped out the car
 and she said to me did you notice the name on the dent ist's did you notice the name on the plaque outside
 and i said no
 and i noticed the black never mind the name
 and she said well the name says gordon s leith dental surgeon
 and gordon's leith is my father
 and i says ah your father's a dentist
 and she said yes
 so now i went to that dentist for years after that you know went every 6 months or whatever it was you know for your checkups
 and
 and kept up you know with the dentist for many many years after that until i went to you know that you've that you went to buses sticking it in leith died because he was a he was a good age when you know he was quite elderly when i went with that night with miss leath
 so he was a good agent he died
 and then i didn't have a dentist for a wee while
 and then i started going to
 and then he was the life long dentist after that looked after you folks teeth as well
 but yeah i loved that school was a great school it's like yeah yeah she was a really really nice person mislead
 and she was really she used to give us all a christmas present everybody got the whole class got a christmas present now it was just a small thing you know maybe a penny dainty or something like that
 but the great thing was that you got called out your desk you got you got caught out of your seat to come
 and get it
 and you felt
 so important you know
 and she always me to last i was always the last because i i was alphabetically i was last with nobody behind me alphabetically because i was tea for tate
 and
 and i was always last
 and the anticipation because it was always in a little brown a little brown paper bag
 so you didn't know what what you were going to get
 and everybody got something everybody different
 and oh anticipation of that
 and then you would go out
 and you'd see something like well i hope you have a very nice christmas
 and we'll take care on the roads
 and i will see you after the after the holiday know she always said that every year we had her for years i think
 so she she sticks in my memories as far as teachers are concerned because she was
 so kind
 and she was really kind as well to all the naughty ones you know how you know including myself you had these naughty people
 and she she was the 1 as well um when she'd said i was misbehaving 1 day
 and she said to me get hsi can't didn't know she's here outside no she said out
 and i didn't mean i didn't know whether she meant out the class or out the school out of dundee or out of everything
 so i thought well if you stand outside the door
 and the headmaster comes along you get into trouble because he knows you've been put out for being naughty
 so i thought well the only thing to do is go home
 and i went right out of school
 and the thing was i knew that that if i got home once i got home there would be nobody in that i would be stuck because my mum was working all of us at school my brother was home on leave from army
 but i wasn't very sure about that whether he would be home it was a winter's day a dark day
 and when i came up to near the prefab i could see the light on in the bathroom
 so i knew i knew he was in
 so i went in
 and he said to me why you home you should be at school
 and i first of all said i was
 and i wasn't feeling i was feeling sick
 so that's first of all i thought try that tack to me this is neil
 and he said to me you don't look sick
 and i saw do he got really sore tummy
 and eventually it came out that i'd been put out because i was wanting to ask him whether she meant i forever or just out
 so he well if you've been naughty i think you've probably been told to get out of the classroom not out of the whole school school
 and certainly not out of education the education system
 so you say no you don't know what you have to
 and i said no he says well you have to go right back after lunchtime
 and you have to stand at our desk
 and the school bell rings line up then you go to her you get into school get into the classroom go to our desk
 and say miss leith i'm really sorry for misbehaving this morning
 and i won't do it again
 and then i said well no see i can't do that because everybody'll laugh
 and he says well that's why you have to do it that's why you've got to say you're really sorry
 and you won't do it again
 and i was going back down the road saying i'm not doing that i'm not doing that i'm just going to sit in the classroom
 and i'm not saying anything i'm just going to go in go to my desk
 and sit down
 and i went into the classroom
 and i don't know why i did this i don't know why i did it to this day
 but i sort of sidled up to the desk
 and she was trying not to look at me could see me at the corner of her eye was trying not to look at me eventually she turned round
 and she said yes
 and i said what neil said for me to say with great difficulty
 but
 but i said it
 and she just said 1 word sit
 so i just turned from the desk
 and
 but then i was happy because i thought i'm back in again you know i wasn't quite sure how things were going to go if i was out forever you how was it going to learn things or or when could i play in the playground if i wasn't the you know
 so i was happy to be back in that school system again quite known for that kind of
 so weren't you because there was the time at nursery as well that you just sort of might be able to huh well i was actually able from school because you see i was brought up in the nursery
 and i was in the nursery when i was months old because my mom had to go to work
 and there was all these council nurseries where babies were taken in because it was just after the war
 and you know things were very very different
 and anyway i was brought up in ellen gown nursery every day i went there
 and i was virtually just taken home at night
 and put to bed
 so the nursery was my home the nursery was my was really like my home
 and when i went to school i went to school the first day when you know was taken in registered
 and everything
 and at play time when we came out to play i just walked out the school
 and walked back to the nursery which was within walking distance of the school i just went right back to the nursery because i thought well it's time to go home now
 and then i'd evidently appeared at a window that very low windows in this nursery school the windows were deliberately low you know the windows actually came down quite
 so that the nurses could see out if the children were playing out
 but i had looked in the window of the matron of the the nursery school
 and she was sitting at her desk writing
 and she looked up
 and she said evidently she said to my mum all she could see was this hid a blonde curls looking in the window
 and thinking oh god she's back she's oh god we've got her back
 so she beckoned to me to come in now i went into her she said to me what are you doing here
 and i said well i just came back because i've been to school now
 and it was okay
 but that's it
 and she said no no you don't come back here oggy you have to stay at school you're at school you don't come to nursery school
 and she phoned the school
 and said you'll have to send her sister along for an olive was in a few primaries above me you'll have to send her sister for
 so olive came for me dragging me on the road because she was fed up she'd been taken out of a class that she was really enjoying art or
 and she had to come
 and collect me
 so she took me back now after that i think i was the start of the locking gates
 and things in schools because then the lock the gate i just walked out of the gate
 and i never actually did go back to the nursery school
 but i was really sad you know because it it really was my my life the nursery it was my home for for all these years
 and the nurses were like mums really you know the nurses we're all because you were taken there like my mum started in the mills at she would probably start at half 7
 so i'd be taking it at the back of 7 just after
 and then i wouldn't be picked up until half 5 quarter to at night
 and then of course you know my mum would be tired
 so it would be taken home
 and bathed or or maybe not even bath just taken home
 and put to bed really
 so that's why it was important that the nursery that's why the nursery school was
 so important to me what was here doing machine also working the mins yeah yeah you see there was no detail look after you because everybody you know my mum's sisters
 and brothers what all in the mill
 and the older the older a different job
 and my my mum was a spool winder which just is exactly what it says you wound the flax onto the
 and there was a that when my mother asked was a weaver
 and there was a finisher
 and there was a flattener
 and there was a sparker
 and oh there was all the different trades of of the jew industry
 and all worked in different parts of it you know my mum said at 1 stage there was a member of the family in every every sector of the mill right at the beginning
 and then because the flax goes through different processes you know it arrives off the ships from packet or arrived off the ships from pakistan
 and then it went through various processes
 and my mum reckoned at 1 stage you know the family had all grown up
 and at 1 stage there was 1 of them in each in each area of the mill um siblings did well she was the oldest of 13 chad chad chad 12 brothers
 and sisters i thought there was 6 girls
 and 7 boys 6 girls
 and 7 boys twins joseph
 and james they died in they were about 4 months old evidently when they died
 but that was common long ago sadly because that was before inoculations
 and that's when things where people with that size of a family certainly couldn't afford to nourish them all know they wouldn't they wouldn't be all well nourished i wouldn't
 and they lived a very hard life in a very very small house in the centre of the town near the docks
 and my mum being the oldest had all the work had a lot of work to do you know besides her besides her job she had a lot of work to do in the house with the children
 and it doesn't sound like a great life at all it wasn't a good life at your mum's dad was he my mum's dad yeah he was called joseph
 and he was he was a bit of a a dead horse through the years my mum would put it because he drank very heavily
 and he worked he worked on the docks he worked was a what they call a plater
 and that was a skill that that was to do with ship building plating was to do with you know putting the outside pieces on the on the actual ship
 and
 so that's when my grandfather did
 but very often he was never at his work because he couldn't lift his head off the pillow if he was really drunk
 but magrani used to be able to go down
 and get his wages yeah she would go to the docks
 and they knew what my grandfather was like
 and they knew that she had this huge family
 and she used to get just picked up his wages he didn't touch his wages
 and
 but said he always got money somewhere for she's never never yet really knew where he got it from
 but he always managed to get money for drink
 so she had a very hard life extremely hard life
 and yet she was very tough very resilient means she was in her 80s
 and she was still helping you know washing nappies for her various you know grandchildren
 and whatever else
 so she was really a bit of a character that's yes yes she couldn't get round your name kenneth she couldn't she mean kerris that she never heard of it of course
 but then it sounded really like a boy
 so she couldn't couldn't cope with that at all
 but yeah i think i had a really really hard time
 and when my mum was expecting this just gives you an idea the culture at the time when my mum was expecting me mum her mum was my gran had gone to the pictures had gone to see a film
 and they were sitting in the pictures
 and my mum you know the her due date was a few weeks away
 so
 but she started to feel uncomfortable in the pictures
 and she said to my grana not really not feeling too good
 so my well she listened to her saying that if we found eventually she'd all come on we'll walk up the road
 so they started to walk up the road
 and walking up the road was becoming more
 and more uncomfortable for my mum it wasn't that far
 but it was up a hill
 and she was
 and she really was uncomfortable anyway they got up to the circle round about where my granny lived because we were going back to my
 and her my mum's brothers several of my mum's brothers were hanging about on the corner as they did in these days
 so my granny says you better go down for the midwife
 and my mumma definitely said i don't think i'm needing a midwife i think i've still got a bit to go yet
 but i'm really uncomfortable my granny said to thomas go
 and get the midwife thomas took t seals
 and ran down through mccrady to find the midwife by which time now we had got where my mum
 and my gran had got home
 and my gran said to my mumma you better go through
 and lie down because she had been looking a bit white
 and poorly
 so she went through to lie down
 and i came into the world
 and my gran said the midwife arrived
 and my granddaughter said too late know she's the baby's born
 so my grand virtually brought me into
 so that was you know that was that quite a few people you know a few of the neighbors that had gone into to labour too quick you know the midwives didn't get there in time my gran thought nothing of it that means you'd had 13 of her own she knew then she knew delivered some of she knew fine what to do
 and
 so on
 so i mean it was quite nice because she used to tell me years later that you know she had brought me into the world
 and fortunately it was quite an easy birth you know there was no complication i'm sure if there's complications then you'll have to get into hospital
 but most babies in these days were born at home
 and you only went to hospital to have your baby in these days if there was a complication most infants were born at home
 so my granny certainly brought me into the world
 and was it common in was it coming for men to be round no oh no oh no it wasn't common for men to be around when you were born kennis some men did it some men chose to do it
 but it wasn't common
 and i think a lot of it don't even think it was
 so much the men didn't want to be there the hosp didn't want them there it they've changed you see that's all changed now with hospital
 and i think it's changed for the better the hospital recognizes that mums want the dad there want their husbands there in some cases
 but in in certainly in my mums my god my my my dad well certainly my dad was at you know he was in the navy
 and he was away with the war
 but i would have doubted if he would have been there
 and none of the boys were allowed in the room you know none of the brothers or or certainly my brothers were allowed into the room yeah it was very very different in these days
 but i think i think my mum by the time i came along had probably just had enough babies you know should have brought practically brought up all her own siblings
 and then she had of her own i think she just well had enough by that time
 and that's right that's right
 so i mean it was it was hard for her there's no doubt about it
 but yeah it just seems it seemed that long ago
 but
 and yet in some ways it's a million light years from from nowadays know how things have changed
 and
 and some things have definitely changed for the better
 but i still think some things were were better in our day in that you know we could we could play in the street there's no i mean cars never came along our street cars i was was it wasn't in a car until i was about because
 and the only reason i was in a car was because i was a float guy at our next door neighbour's wedding
 and olive
 and i got to sit in a in a car
 and we thought that was amazing
 and i i got gloves that was another amazing thing i got i mean i didn't worry i was like you
 and you were little cares never liked dresses
 and things neither did i
 and the only way i would wear the dress was i had gloves i got to wear these gloves
 and i remember my mum saying i mean it's ridiculous you know she doesn't like wearing a dress
 but she's happy to wear the gloves
 so for some reason we had these little white you know wrist gloves
 and i thought it was i was really something in these gloves
 and yeah
 so you think do you think it's much safer then for children or do you think it's just that we hear more about what goes on i think it was generally safer
 and yet i was to hear away from the street
 but we wouldn't go into
 but i think it was generally safer
 and the reason for that is that an awful lot of the neighbors hung around the street there was more there was more community spirit i think then
 and that might be just because even if the layout of the houses i don't know
 but there seemed to in our street there was a 2 shops on the end of the street you know there was grocer
 and a grocer like a fruit shop
 and a
 so
 and the the the ladies of the street certainly the elderly ladies of the street used to sit on the short window sills
 and you know share their snuff boxes
 and chatter away of an evening know they were all there was always somebody in the street
 so of course when kids were playing you know the fell over or they were unwell or they were fighting something these elderly ladies were unwittingly babysitters you know because they'd say hey stop that or you know they they would get involved in some fracas if if anything was happening
 and i think that culture has gone i think that cultures gone because people are well i think i think it might have just been the layout of the buildings
 and everything not sure
 and the fact that it was there was no traffic came along the street
 and there was no buses you see in these days it was tram cars
 and the tram cars down the main street because of the cable line
 so the street really was a playground the street was the playground
 and we had we had baxter park
 but then you couldn't walk to baxter park unless somebody took you there you know because it was a fairly step for us
 but the boys you know my brothers they they played in the street they played football on the street
 and there was air rage there was air raid shelters around the back in our clothes you know foot for the war
 and of course they weren't taken down even after the war finished
 so the best thing in the world was to climb on the top of them
 and there would be maybe 910 feet you know they weren't that high
 but high when you're wee of course you weren't allowed on them there was a big rule
 and kids weren't allowed on the like to go in them
 but they weren't allowed to go on the top of them
 and they were all manner of ways of wooden ladders
 and things
 and we we sort of piles of stones that that would be erected to get you up onto the they were all hidden around from the from the windows hidden around the back
 so that your mum if she looked out she couldn't see climbing onto the shed you never climbed on a shelter of course that was within sight of your own window everybody went to another shell
 and there was 1 day that oliver knee where you know they'd got me up onto the shabs about 3 seemingly
 and they got me up onto this shelter
 and i mean we were just we just felt we were
 so mischievous
 and being
 so dared devilish you know on the top of the shelter
 and i can remember actually being a bit wimpy
 and thinking you know seemed
 so high once
 and then the next thing was the policeman came through the big bend
 and all because he was the top of his helmet
 and all of his estimate lie flat on your face
 and don't say a word
 so i'm spread eagle down the top of this shelter
 and little did we know that this guy could just stand on the pile of stones that we got up on
 and then we could see his whole head looking across
 and all he did was great big man
 and he did was put over these massive hand pluck me off of
 and you know lift me down
 but drop me about a foot from the bombs
 so that it didn't get down with too much ease
 and any licked his pencil shift through his notebook to get to the right page
 and then he said name
 so of course your name meant in the policeman's book
 and the idea now was the policeman going to to your door
 and tell your mum you'd been on the shelters
 so all of a sudden i decided we were actually going to have to run away we could not go home because the punishment would fit the crime
 and the crime was bad
 and the punishment would be worse
 so we thought well we'll just make a run for it
 so we went out the close
 and we got along to the end of the street
 and olive just kept saying to me just keep following me just keep following me
 and then we looked up the street
 and all of a sudden see was my gran coming down albert bustling a shoulder she always came down
 so she was on a mission she came down
 and she shouted
 so of course she seemed to do this you see
 so olive goes up are you doing what are you doing on the end of the street 1 is supposed to be on the end of the you're supposed to be in the middle of the street
 so olive said we're just we're just looking for somebody she's well get
 and that meant get meant get home
 so we just didn't tail
 and went back
 and we were sort of sat outside for a while thinking well has he been yet has he been to the door yet or or will he go after because we thought well we need to we need to get some tea sometime
 so we're unsure whether we should go
 and have the tea
 and then get the belting or i would just not go
 but i'm not i mean i've got this story in my head
 and i'm not just sure what happened
 but certainly we never got into trouble
 so i don't think the guy ever went near the door don't think the policeman did
 but on saying that we never went on the shelters again because we've just got such afraid that if my mum i give a policeman went to your door i mean that was the end of the world you know can you remember russian's name hydration books right up until we didn't have rashing books in fintry
 so we'd imagine i think 1948 or 4849 would be the end of the rationing i think
 and that's why i would never any sweeties because you did get coupons for sweeties
 but you could swap them for coupons for an egg this kind of thing of course my main sweeties were were for rich children you know
 so we never ever got sweeties i can remember getting an easter egg when i was quite big when i say that maybe 8 or 9 from uncle john
 but oliver 9 easter egg
 and ah i mean you just thought all your birthdays come together an easter egg to yourself
 and morning woolworths
 and the woman went to put mine in a bag you know put it in a bag
 and i didn't want in a bag because i had to show off i wanted everybody in the world to see this easter egg i really show off that it was mine
 and of course my mum confiscated the easter egg as soon as we got home the easter egg was put into the cupboard
 and we were only allowed a tiny little bit every day
 and she was allowed a tiny little bit of our easter egg every day
 so with the result that easter egg lasted seemed to last forever
 but we just we just any mean you couldn't steal it know you couldn't mean that did occur to us without we could go
 and steal a bit more
 but she knew she knew was data easter eggs
 so you could not steal it
 and
 and i reckon i've got a theory on this because i reckon that's why we all had good teeth you know we never had a blind toothbrush
 but then we never had sweeties
 and we didn't have biscuits you know you didn't have a lot of sweet things didn't have really a lot of anything
 but you certainly didn't have a lot of sweet things
 but you have got a love got a lot of happy memories i don't have memories sadly of like ever getting on my mum's knee or getting a story or not have any story books or i loved i loved going to the the little storey storey in the library there's a little storytelling classes where you could primaries
 and 3 got allowed to go to the library
 and a lady would come
 and read a story to you
 and that was great i loved that because this lady would make all the characters come to life
 and she would speak like the character did now
 so that was really clever because because she became that character in the book you know
 but after you came out of primary 3 that was it know you never got another story in your life that was the end of stories
 so i don't have memories of that kind of home life
 but i have have happy memories of situations
 and incidents at school
 and outside of home life you know i love that when did you start going skating that's the thing that like yeah skating i started to go when i was probably in secondary school yeah started going when i was started to try
 and learn to skate
 and that was a laugh because you know you spent more time on the on the ice than you did on your feet
 but
 but eventually you know after years of years of playing on became quite a good skater certainly quite a good speed skater peter used to like to go up at the what they call the lady speed
 and you know the ladies would go
 and go around as fast as they could
 and then there was the men's speed then there was the dancing
 and i didn't wasn't good enough for that
 but yeah they danced on ice yeah maureen golden i remember maureen golden the first time i ever saw her ever saw her was on the ice
 and it was only after he met up with her years later i said to her i recognise you you used to be a nice a dance iced dance skate didn't
 and she said yes she had the most beautiful i remember she always had different costumes on
 and she was very very good chief secretary ice dan skater
 and i still have watching it at that most people just went away
 and had a cup of tea or a drink of juice when the
 but on
 but i always did was just like to the a few couples would go
 and do the dancing together it really it really was good
 but yeah we like skating the skating well i got i thought i was really really something i got a pair of wine burgundy corduroy trousers
 and a white polo neck jumper
 and that was a really trendy in these days really trendy
 and then i can't remember i had a skating skirt i had a skating skirt because girls wore skating skirts in these days'cause
 and i can remember just not liking it because i thought it was too long
 and i said to olive you know sister could you could you could you shorten that for me you know can't do anything for herself said could you shorten that for me
 and
 so she starts to pin up a bit you see
 and i want it shorter than that it shorter than that
 and she was seeing you couldn't get it any shorter than now for goodness sake
 and i think it was neil neil
 and you know came in
 and all this nonsense
 and me saying i didn't know
 and
 and he said no you don't he said it's that's a good length away that is just now he said always remember it's what people don't see it's more interesting not what they see
 and i've never forgotten that
 so anyway i got my skirt that the the decent length
 and that was that
 but we didn't wear skirts too long
 and then or or too you know it was mostly it was mostly trousers because it was cold you know
 and if you went down were the skating skirt on know you were you're soaking you know in a your trousers give you a wee bit more protection
 and it was great fun i loved guess where i met my first boyfriend bill bill heron i swear i met him
 but he really fancied my friend he fancied my friend carol raines
 so it was really after things things just went sideways in cairo i had to wait in line
 and then after things went really sad with him
 and carol he started to skate around with me that was what you you the meant the boys came
 and sort of skated alongside you when i think back
 and he offered me a piece of his chewing gum that was quite serious that was it i thought he was probably the next question would be would be wanting to marry me that wasn't the next question the next question was how far do you live from the ice rink that was before he said i walk you home
 so you had to wait
 and see how far it was
 and was in his direction now
 and fortunately it was kind of indiana his direction
 and saw beline sort of skated around together went for wee walks you know maybe about at this time went for wee walks on a sunday around cape park
 and scintillating stuff
 and i i like i liked he had a lovely little sister i remember there was there was bill
 and then there was this huge gap you know
 and then his mum had this unexpected little baby you know a little girl
 and she i i remember
 and i just thought she was gorgeous like it was shirley temple only blonde
 and sometimes he used to come with her
 and we would take her to the park
 and
 and stuff like that
 and then we just sort of drifted you know it was drifted away
 but certainly the skating that the first boyfriend was was on the cards yeah skating was really good fun
 and again it was dead safe because we used to come out the skating
 and walk all the way home you know along the kingsway all the way home was a long way that was quite a long way
 but there was never any trouble or anybody being in attacked or assaulted or mugged or anything like that know it was it seemed to be dead safe yeah it was good you liked skating too didn't you yeah yeah yeah
