 perhaps you could just start by introducing yourself in terms of how are you scottish or whatever
 and background
 and
 so on either of you well okay well i'm june surname i've lived in scotland for since 19 off
 and on born in england with a scottish mother
 and english father
 and married to a scotsman who is who is me
 and me is who who am i
 no keep going honestly just keep just say where you were lived here all my first years in rutherglen
 and since then hamilton
 and are are your parents also were they also scottish
 yes my mum my mum might just have been born in england
 but i thought your mother was english from just a month or 2 old she was brought to
 but
 so she considered herself to be scottish even if she wasn't actually born here
 yes aye grandparents would be right what did they do my well my grandfather died before my mother was born if you can remember right actually
 so i think he was an armature winder he was a what armature winder what's an armature winder somebody who winds armatures well like for thanks right what's an armature big big coils isn't that part of a motor part of an electric motor armature is electrical coil on a right kind of aware of the word
 but i didn't know what it in those days women didn't work
 but when my grandfather was my grandmother was widowed she opened a shop near celtic park actually
 and sweets selling
 and such like
 so i'm told cause all my all 4 of my grandparents were deceased before i was born right i never knew any of them i actually had an an irish i my my who had you had maternal grandmother was of irish stock i can't actually remember her her name at the moment
 but it was she came over they came over from ireland
 so they came over to scotland from ireland
 yes my cause there's quite a lot of irish in the north of england i think liverpool
 and newcastle
 and
 so on
 yes
 no that was my my maternal 1 not paternal
 yeah well the same as glasgow as far as i know my my dad's parents are both well
 and truly english
 but my mum's mum was from ireland i can't remember her name
 and you've still got relatives around the dundee area oh the dundee
 yeah aye swarming with them i think swarming well my father had dundee strong dundee connections in the did he have any particular words that he used that weren't that that were that sort of pinned him down as dundee rather than west coast anything that you remember that was not that i remember because different i i i don't really know dundee words to say that's a dundee 1 they're just well they they use'ken a lot did he do that ken do you ken something ken oh
 no that's up north that's you ken cause my auntie mina
 and the rest of the family use that although my mother didn't cause she'd been in england a long time
 but my auntie mina
 and them used to say ken
 but 1 thing when we were talking about this that appleringie thing recently which is a word i hadn't heard since childhood my mother called it
 yeah
 but dad's dad my father called it what was it flechinel flechinel
 and yet he was from the dundee area as
 no well he wasn't the family had connections there
 but it was really clydebank he lived in all his oh right the background then life till they got to fill in the backstory of this cause obviously i i know what you're talking about
 but the rest of the world might not right it's appleringie is what southernwood or
 and the only time i'd ever heard it called appleringie was as a child it was in the garden
 and it was always appleringie i always had this it's very scented isn't it southernwood aye very sort of herbally smell
 and i always used to have this
 yes picture of kind of rings of apple with the the cores core missing it always brought up the there were always sort of dried rings of apple it was always what i thought as i say southernwood
 and then this flechinel i think we looked up'flechie i can't remember what it meant
 but we looked up'flechie cause you weren't sure how it was don't know aye i would spell it does the'flechie part of the word mean anything in particular same as
 yeah
 but i can't remember we'd have to look at the dictionary
 yeah right oh we'll maybe just leave it just now aye we we worked out counted how it came to be called
 but the only other kind of scottish word i can remember that sticks in my mind when i was young was the word'sleekit because i didn't even know it was scottish until i used it in a it was an essay
 and it was i was writing about a character in something like barchester towers who was called i think it was mr slope he had the name that suggested his character
 and i used the word'sleekit
 and i got the essay back
 and there was a query beside it
 and luckily the the english teacher was scottish he was from glenrothes
 so he knew what it
 but ididn't
 but it's quite is it not quite common or quite as a scottish word exactly
 yeah well apparently not
 no he said right well how many well it's a burns it's used in burns wee sleekit cowerin timrous beastie people in england would know much about burns
 but if they knew anything that would be the line they'd oh hm well it seemed apparently it was a a word i shouldn't be using in an english essay cause it was just a scottish
 so it stuck in my
 so when you moved up to scotland what did you notice any or did it come as a shock did you the first thing that happened got off the train at queen were there words you didn't understand it would be january 19 oh
 no it was how come queen street coming up from the south
 no east that's where we got off oh
 yeah from through up to edinburgh
 and then across right edinburgh to
 and it was rag week
 and there were all these strange people on the station we wondered what we'd come to cause they were all dressed up
 and rag that's why i think i thought it was january
 but maybe it was february all these weird
 no i think it was
 and then before we came once we'd applied for jobs
 and got jobs i remember there was a story in the the paper about a body found in a bin in glasgow which kind of made us think twice about it
 but we came
 yeah
 and then we met in 19 at february can you remember where well remembered oh the pink elephant the white
 no white elephant oh
 yeah white white elephant disco disco
 yes sauchiehall in sauchiehall street it later became oh i can't remember what it changed its name to it has several is it still there or is there still a club in the same building it is there is still a club there i'm sure it was on the the first floor of a building
 and we met there because we were both in the young conservatives it was a young conservatives disco isn't there a story that you you were there with a friend
 and the friend said you have the lanky 1 cause i want the other 1 or is that just the version you told me i don't think it was
 no you take the big 1
 and i'll take the other 1 you take the big 1 or something
 yeah that was gordon
 and that was pat who you were there with
 yes pat was
 yeah pat was the other 1
 so that was before pat met ian then it oh
 yes ian was when we went in
 but it was after you'd left tunbridge wells that's right 19 we went down to tunbridge wells
 and she met him down there he's very english there you go
 so what was glasgow like in those days in the early seventies late sixties early seventies or what was that what was that club or disco like what was what sort of well there was 1 of these big glitter balls i remember that was that the
 yeah
 yeah
 and in the early seventies are they that old i would have put them as oh
 yes
 and before another place that was popular was the majestic for known as the magic stick magic
 and then there was the highlanders near charing cross which was very lively that was a lively place to go on a saturday you got dancing there you got flung around the room really i remember that
 yeah
 yeah all
 so is that sort of scottish country dancing is that is that what you did in the the the 1 in sauchiehall street sort of ceilidh oh
 no
 no
 no that was as well or was that like normal
 no
 no
 no
 no
 no rock pop stuff sort of you know sort of rock
 and pop
 and stuff
 and
 and they all finished about teno'clock at night
 and you got the bus was it as early as that well we didn't from there because gordon had a car gordon i'm sure he had a
 so did oh that night
 yes
 so did you aye that night well he used his mother's mini van
 but the 4 of us wouldn't get into oh maybe that was into a how mini was the van well i wouldn't have been sitting in the back with
 no seat there would be 2 seats in the front well like a mini car there was a van a van version of a mini oh right right i i thought you meant it was a van
 but a small van well it was a van just 2 windows at the front panels behind right like a a del boy there were a lot more oh it had 4 wheels with 4 wheels smaller than that a mini van was smaller than oh i don't know it was like the mini it was a variant of the mini there were more department stores in glasgow then big ones in sauchiehall street there was copeland
 and lye pettigrew's
 and was watt bros there at that time
 and then there was another oh
 yeah
 yeah it still looks treron et cie where treron treron was up treron et treron ici where the et that was up where the mclellan galleries are known in glasgow as trero treron
 and there was another 1 muirhead's or something further down on the same side as fraser's of course there used there were 2 fraser's fraser's
 and why were there
 so many department stores
 and that was the way of things in those there were less there were fewer sort of chain shops big
 yeah it all tended to be the big which were excellent you could get anything especially copeland
 and lye i remember they used to have a good sort of haberdashery department
 and there was a a lovely restaurant it was ma brown's it was called m
 and a brown's the cake shop
 and there was a restaurant downside down the stairs from it nearer charing cross in sauchiehall has that not been there that was has there not been a a cake shop still not ma
 no it's
 no it's bradford's it's different right aye it was further down well it was probably around cause ma brown's sounds while you were young
 but it was the downstairs which aye it was 1 high tea we got right you might have been there for high tea 1 night do you want to explain the concept of a high tea i don't think that's a oh right oh well it's more scottish than english i would say you don't really get high teas in england
 so you could do that exactly hm well it was a meal that you had around early evening consisting of often fish
 and a main course rather than a a main course certainly fish
 and chips would feature steak pie gammon
 and like frequently in omelette that was always an
 and a plate of oh there would be toast or bread bread
 and butter with it bread
 and butter i remember from 1 in ayr choice of tea or coffee
 and tea or coffee with cakes which came with your how continental on a on a plate on a sort of
 yeah
 yeah a tiered cake tray thing a tiered cake
 yeah choice of well probably scones or usually a scone
 and a crumpets pancakes nice could you just i i don't really remember this well i i do i remember the concept
 but i don't obviously wasn't paying for things when i was like 5
 so did you pay for what you had or did you oh just pay for the whole lot
 and you could eat them all if you wanted
 no i think
 yes that's oh well there was there was a limited amount put like if you were at a table for 4 there would be 4 cakes out
 and you'd well
 no you'd kind of eye up deciding which 1 you right right
 so you'd fight over the best i remember doing that wanted
 and you pineapple cake or eiffel eiffel tower fine fern cake a fern cake i remember down at ayr a fern cake remember down at ayr at the was it the county hotel in the square there
 and we were there with could have peg
 and ted from
 and
 yeah
 and i remember that
 yeah grandma was there as well right
 and the cakes came
 and i remember there were a couple of sort of good cream cakes
 and then kind of ordinary things
 and peg
 and your mother both grabbed empire for the cream cakes
 and we were left with the empire biscuits aye oh empire oh that was something my mother always called them belgian biscuits i don't know why
 but they were belgian biscuits when she made right is that because is that because of her scottish roots or the english thing or just i don't oh probably not cause they were always empire a biscuits up here
 but they were always belgian biscuits when i was stovies that's another thing stovies that's very scottish well maybe it's very not around my household it wasn't
 so what did you eat in your household then that's what we had for what meals do you remember from well didn't you have days of the week for things oh in those days we
 but fish on a friday
 no then it
 no
 no can i say why well
 yeah we had fish on a tuesday because fishing boats didn't go out on a sunday night for religious reasons for fisherman being very
 so when they went out on a monday night back on the tuesday we got fresh fish every tuesday for tea that night hm fish was a fish is something that the roman catholics have on a friday
 yeah
 so protestant protestant householdsdidn't why is that is it because they avoid meat or
 yeah right
 yes have have it then see
 yes that's what sort of fish sole haddock
 and oh cod or haddock was all we ever
 no sometimes it would be a bit of it would be lemon sole nice bit of lemon aye probably cod
 and haddock would be more the yellowy haddock aye
 yes smoked dyed it could have been
 yeah right is that what makes it yellow well it was
 and then we would have herring my mother would make potted herring in the summer months with herring from loch fyne is that rollmops you used to buy those in
 yes the fishmonger remember the fishmonger
 and fruit shop combined oh i can't macfisheries you used to get rollmops in macfisheries you used to get rollmops in in hamilton when they had a a when they had oh oh
 yes probably on the deli counter
 yes i didn't like them
 but pat used to buy them i don't think i've ever had 1 oh well i don't think i ever had them
 but i didn't think i liked there was there was a business in glasgow which is still there called mcphees who were fishing fish merchants
 and their slogan on the vans was fresh from the sea to mcphee right there's 1 in byres road it's jack mcphee though is it not oh well it's probably the same family right cause i was thinking they use that slogan i think
 but then i don't know oh
 so did it come sorry did it come round in a van the fish
 no
 no that was delivering to the shops right
 so you would just go out to the shop
 and get it
 but wasn't monday always the the remains of the sunday roast that was your monday dinner
 yes boiled ham roast roast beef chicken whatever we had had over the weekend would be used up on a monday what about puddings well there's a lot of scottish often enough custard
 and fruit oh
 yeah custard or out of bird's out of a tin oh aye bird's powdered powdered
 and then rice pudding boiled baked rice sometimes though i didn't like the oh baked rice with the skin on oh oh i did i loved that brown skin
 and the nutmeg on it which i didn't do you like nutmeg now not greatly still not didn't think you had a problem with i probably wouldn't i probably wouldn't ignore it altogether if it was there
 but did you know that you know i wouldn't specify nutmeg on my on my rice pudding particularly there was semolina sometimes which i didn't like really
 and there would be well my mother never made things like tapioca
 and sago puddings luckily because she didn't like them either probably you know the texture of them she didn't
 and i certainly never took to those can't i can't remember what sort of here i heard something on radio just this morning
 and it brought back a memory you know how when you buy jelly these days to make a jelly dessert it's a jelly texture you get
 yeah tablet it used to be crystals ah it used to be jelly i remember my mother got used to make jelly aye somebody's found the last tin of creamola foam in the crystals really when did they stop making that in a not very long i used to like creamola foam oh we had it up to the nineties i'm you used to like it when you were little
 yes aye it's the factory stopped it it's only about 7 or 8 years ago i think it's great stuff we used to buy lemonade powder in woolworth's you used to buy it loose like by the it's made quarter pound or shovel it in a bag for you you i suppose it was sort of creamola foam thing
 but it was always lemonade
 yeah
 but
 and is it being sold on ebay this last tin
 no i think it's going to a museum isn't it i can't remember oh
 no somebody is buying it to try
 and crack the oh to analyse it oh the ingredients
 so that they could start making it although whether'll allow them to do that or not i don't know because they might still have the the rights to well they could call it something else
 but
 yes i don't think you can have a copyright over a brand of
 yeah that's what's going to happen to well you could have rights to list of they wouldn't use the creamola foam well say they
 no they would maybe need to is it simple i
 but that's why they keep the ingredients secret presumably
 so that you can't copy change the because
 yeah
 so you know if you can analyse all the ingredients in creamola foam presumably you could do it in
 yeah
 but it's not done apparently if indeed there is a secret ingredient in well maybe there isn't do you sorry on you
 no
 no i was going to say you never stayed to school lunches did you school dinners oh i did at high school they were something
 no oh me
 no
 no never never once did i have a school i always went home for lunch did you do you know what sorts of things people had at school lunches in those days you certainly heard stories of what they sago
 and tapioca for
 and stew i don't know if it was healthy or not well nothing like burgers they didn't exist in those
 but there was nothing well cabbage always smelt the whole school out when it was getting boiled up in the canteen school cabbage it never smelt very satisfying anyway
 no the worst job was when you were on dinner duty when you had to clear the tables
 and you had to go to the slop bin with everything i remember i dropped the plate in ew
 and it broke i didn't dare tell did you just cover it up with some more tapioca
 and urgh i would have thought every individual would have to take their own plate back to a
 no you had a a sort of monitor system
 and you were sort of probably on for a week
 and you were the 1 who cleared the table or something or the 1 who brought the mashed potatoes or
 yeah cause it was brought to the table in big bins
 and the best pudding was fruit
 and shortbread used to get sort of mixed stewed fruit which was really quite nice
 and bits of shortbread
 and that was nice
 but everything else was rubbish except we used to get rice pudding with that sounds quite rosehip syrup
 and i liked the rosehip syrup
 so i used to have a spoonful of that
 and that was it without the rice
 and manchester tart that was do you have that
 no it was a kind of pastry base with a layer of jam
 and then cold custard
 no never heard of it ew
 yeah it probably was
 but i just i expected not to like school dinners
 so i tended not to eat probably alright actually
 but it sounds a bit odd custard in a tart what sort of games did you play at school at playtimes or was that before games were invented marbles or jauries they were called just tig i can't remember what else i was at primary school when the hula hoop first came i got a pale green girls girls would have their ropes skippingcan't remember what else we might have football
 no you wouldn't play
 no not near all the windows in the school i just stood on corners
 and talked a lot even as 6 year olds i don't very sophisticated we were i doubt it probably remember all this afterwards when you're away well we can do it again some time i remember when used to be outside
 and you got these woven mats they were sort of oval mats
 and you all had to take a mat out
 and put it on the playground
 and sort of lie on it
 and do exercises
 and things as the weather was dry it wasn't
 no didn't do if it was warm in the summer cause we did have playing fields at our primary school we would be out running races
 and doing things like that sports day
 but we never played anything like football or cricket or hockey or anything like that there was never anything organised by school for that
 no not even in in sessions
 no did you get
 yes
 but then in those days it was just you just had 1 teacher for the whole year who taught academic subjects practical subjects
 and
 and whatever else this is primary school though well i think that's that's true now is it not they weren't there weren't specialists brought in for
 no surely you have a gym teacher
 and you have och you must well in secondary school we
 no i don't well not in my day you had the same teacher for aye secondary school
 yes secondary school
 yeah
 but that's very oh in primary you i i don't believe it's i don't know don't you get nomadic teachers what's the other word peripatetic well you do you do for things like music you do for music
 and stuff pathetic teachers i don't think you do for things like you'd have to ask don't you i can't see carol oh we'd better not tape this don't worry we won't give her name out well she plays badminton with her or she takes them for badminton right enough
 so she teaches badminton at primary well there you go which seems to be a sort of regular it's not an activity i don't oh was it i thought it was maybe after because i remember her saying today that she'd said to them certain things i have you have to be here for
 but you know sort of badminton if you don't behave i can throw you out
 so it must be a voluntary ah
 but it'll just be throw them out from you know go
 and sit
 and watch you're not playing you're bad
 no
 no
 no
 no i think it was they were there of their own free will time oh i don't know or something at lunchtime i had something else i can't remember it oh
 yes i remember my mother used to work in a chocolate factory in in dundee called lindsay
 and rowe i remember that what kind of chocolate did they make i don't know i just knew it was a chocolate factory it was something i kind of grew up knowing
 and she used to say it kind of put you off chocolate a bit though she did aye i was gon na ask get her taste back for it after she left i don't remember being off it
 and my grandparents in monifieth lived in a the bottom floor of a tenement in oh wellside place or something i can't just remember the name i remember they used to go in a dark close
 and there's this probably doesn't exist it was off to the right
 and there was oh there'd be a tiny wee sort of kitchen area you went through that
 and you could get out in there was a a lovely green at the back
 and the washhouses at the far end there was a flower border right up the top of the flats
 and a very old tortoise lived there called oh used to see him whenever i went he was reputedly about a hundred years old
 but he probably wasn't thank you
 but oh there was a big alright big feather bed in the corner of the sort of living room they did have a bedroom
 but there was also a big you know in the the sort of in the recess there was a big feather bed bed which was lovely
 and a little the fireplace with the sort of wee seat that you could sit beside is that the word is that an
 no just a a sort of you used to get fireplaces with the sort of seats sort of at the corner like little sort of stool i think it's that you sit on i can't remember if it had 1 of those or not did it have a toilet an indoor toilet probably not i doubt it
 but i can't actually remember although i must have used it cause we used to go there for a week at a time there wouldn't be a never really visited my father's cousin who was
 no wouldn't be a bathroom at all well auntie mina was round the shared toilet corner in brook street
 and she had a they had an inside toilet
 but they didn't have a bathroom
 and they had a tiny wee
 so what did they have a tin bath to use in front of the fire we just used to get washed in the kitchen at the kitchen sink well you when you were visiting
 but what about others oh i don't know i don't think adults who lived there
 but they were posh cause they had a front room with a piano in it it was a bedroom as well
 but it had a a piano in it okay you used to there's 2 2 lines of thought i was going along at the same time you used to have roller skates did you or roller skate singular i i i had roller skates was that when they were quite new i haven't a clue when roller skates were oh
 no they were my cousin ian's handed down
 and ruth's after him right
 so you got them as to me i had them you didn't use you didn't use never wore 2 at did you alternate to save the tyres
 and i didn't they didn't have tyres they were metal wheels oh right
 no they were i think they were well rubber rubber tyres on
 yeah my my first ones had metal wheelsi'm sure
 and they made a heck of a racket when you went down the street on they were certainly all all shiny metal frame with a leather with that nut underneath that you used to adjust the length on
 but that was like my first pair of roller skates did to adjust
 but what
 and the ones we put into the jumble sale down at the remember we put them in aye there was there was something about did you i remember somebody that's where mine went after i'd finished with them or i'm sure they where i got them from had a a killed somebody aye i don't remember that at
 no there was something about it did they used to bend or something
 no there was something wrong with it was it was it wonky wheel or something
 but you could get new right what you called tyres for it was a sort of square wheel on it skidding to a
 but whether anyone would ever bother putting another
 yeah very good for braking
 yeah
 no that's oh that kind of braking
 yes
 yeah aye well breaking your ankle probably as well
 and were were you also not 1 of the first people in scotland to have jeans oh aye what's the story quite
 yes quite arguably my father's sister in america used to send over parcels maybe 2 or 3 times a year
 and i thought you got them when you were out there you you were sent them right
 no oh
 no it was long before long before it was when i got my first bike bicycle that i think my ninth birthday that was ninth or tenth
 and it was just about then a parcel arrived
 and there was a pair of jeans in it for
 and i would wear them along with a sort of cowboy shirt a checked quite warm heavy sort of
 yes well you must have stood out in rutherglen he was used to standing out he used to go to the beach with a on didn't you there was nobody quite like is this get at jim night is this what it's all about
 no you you did we were talking about it last week when we were at johnnie's the beach down the west coast of scotland is that where you day trips right
 no that was eyemouth actually where that photograph was
 so did you go down to down to ayr down to largs
 and
 so on when you were
 yes i gather my first holiday ever was in i was too young to remember it cause somebody my folks knew had a house in ayr right a a guest house or just they lived there we went
 and stayed
 no just a well i don't know if it was a second house or i can't remember now what it was it was their house
 and we went to stay in
 so you stayed with them
 no i don't think they were there they were on holiday or something they were oh right i see you used to go up the north east as well didn't you i thought
 no my mother
 and father once we went to aberdeen for a holiday it was a disaster
 but oh oh i thought oh i thought you went up with them as it was a disaster why
 no well normally we went to arbroath more often we went to st andrews
 and we did have 1 holiday in eyemouth when i was young
 no aberdeen was a disaster because the daughter of the the people who had the the boarding house as it was called in those days was stealing from my mother's purse which was left in the bedroom hm
 and the police were involved
 and all that sort of thing it rather tainted our view of aberdeen i dare say it's not all like that
 no maybe not
 but you know something happens like that you have a a bad impression of the whole place besides i don't remember the weather being particularly good
 and it was just a big city after all it wasn't really a holiday place although it had the there's a the beach ballroom
 and which well which wasn't in a beach ballroom hm it's still famous in aberdeen beach ballroom oh they still got 1 i don't know what it's used for now
 no it's probably more a is it still a ballroom or is it like a club now a club
 but it was you know famous always been famous as the beach
 no my mother
 and father once i stopped going on holidays with them went to places like up sort of the black isle area
 no it was below that aye elgin inverness sort of ellon ellon elgin ellon there was 1 place in nairn
 no they sort of forres toured around there from where they were new oh you'd been that's where they
 yeah i is that near peterhead isn't it up a bit well it's inland quite a bit from there
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah up in that area the north
 but you used to get your meals included didn't you it was a boarding house
 and you used to get all your meals well you had either or or you had attendance in the sort of early years after the war what do you mean by'attendance the landlady cooked your own food for you i suppose it was down to right
 and landladies couldn't go out
 and buy what they needed for all their
 so you took your own coupons you got well you either got your own food
 and brought it in or you gave the coupons to the landlady
 and she went
 and registered them at her own butcher
 and grocer
 and
 and
 so in effect it was your food
 and she just made it for
 yeah bizarre i didn't know
 but aye well that was because of the war the years
 and rationing still being a
 yeah did you holiday much in scotland when you were young before you moved up here well dundee well
 yes in that relatives monifieth was the the usual used to come up usually just with my mum my dad would be working apart from that the first holiday i remember was in redcar in a caravan i think it rained all
 and i remember buying a little sheila that's my sister
 and i were there
 and we bought little ornaments
 and 1 was a little sort of woman with a barrel beside her you kept matches in
 and the other had a little sort of apron on
 and it changed colour blue when it was going to rain
 and pink when it was going to be dry or something
 and i remember they used to be in the the sort of display cupboard bit at home
 and i broke 1 of them 1 day
 and i remember i i hid the bits in the sugar bowl
 and i hoped they would never be found
 and eventually they i was kind of hoping nobody would ever use the sugar
 and they wouldn't miss them didn't know anything about it when they were found i take it you didn't get away with it
 no i think they suspected
 and apart from that we used to go to cause a a mate of my dad's at work had a caravan
 and he used to to drive us through to the caravan site there or we'd go to scarborough because there was cricket there
 and my dad liked the cricket to play or just to watch
 no
 no
 no he just
 but monifieth was sort of the the place i came to most often was there much there really
 no is there much there now there's probably more now well certainly more houses
 but you just some of came
 and sort of visited relatives
 and
 and went to the beach played all on the beach
 and i remember visiting my cousin she was in the school on the main on the high street in monifieth
 and we went along 1 day at playtime
 and spoke through the railings to her like being at the zoo i i don't remember there being anything on the beach except you used to collect shells
 and further along you would only be able to go
 so far along because it was barry budden which was was that an army camp or something it was a
 and then the other way was broughty ferry which was where my mum

 so he always reckoned he had 2 birthdays like the queen i can't remember what age
 and he was when he joined
 but i've got his papers
 and things upstairs somewhere he was in he must have been stationed up there before he was sent abroad why broughty ferry or just cause it's sort of out of the way
 and i suppose it was popular as a training place relatively unpopulated i suppose dundee was an heavy industry in dundee maybe they were right
 and in fact well my mum lived there after sheila was born in 19
 and my dad must have gone abroad then or shortly after then i can't remember if he was abroad when she was born i don't think

 and then when they moved south sheila can remember they lived with my my gran that's my dad's mother in stockton cause she remembers it it was a a dark house
 and she was scared going upstairs cause it was dark
 and everything she didn't like it there
 and then by the time i was born we'd moved to norton cause i was 8 years younger yep still am yep baby boomer a baby boomer well
 no it was really the year before cause the year above us at school had an extra stream in it because there was

 but well building up to it must have slackened off a bit after the first boom
 but we used to have lots of sort of postcards
 and things that my dad sent
 and photographs he sent sent home where in particular was he abroad if you remember he was in
 and i'm sure he was in africa as
 but india i remember
