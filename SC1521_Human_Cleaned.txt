 perhaps you could just start by introducing yourself in terms of how are you scottish or whatever
 and background
 and
 so on e- either of you first well okay uh-huh well i'm june surname i've lived in scotland for since 19 sixty-nine off
 and on born in england with a scottish mother
 and english father
 and married to a scotsman who is who is me jim
 and me is who who am i
 no ju- keep going honestly just keep going uh-huh just say where you were born lived here all my life first twenty-six years in rutherglen
 and since then hamilton uh-huh
 and are you- are your parents also were they also scottish
 yes my mum my mum might just have been born in england
 but i thought your mother was english right from just a month or 2 old she was brought to glasgow
 but
 so she considered herself to be scottish even if she wasn't actually born here
 yes aye uh-huh grandparents would be english okay right what did they do my grandparents well my grandfather died before my mother was born if you can remember right actually
 so i think he was an armature winder he was a what armature winder what's an armature winder somebody who winds armatures well like for motors thanks right what's an armature big big coils isn't that part of a motor part of a- an electric motor armature is uh-huh electrical coil on a motor right kind of aware of the word
 but i didn't know what it meant in those days women didn't work
 but when my grandfather was my grandmother was widowed she opened a shop near celtic park actually
 and sweets confection selling right
 and such like
 so i'm told cause uh-huh all my all 4 of my grandparents were deceased before i was born right i never knew any of them i actually had an an irish grandmother i my my who had you had oh maternal grandmother was of irish stock i can't actually remember her her name at the moment
 but it was i- she came over they came over from ireland
 so they came over to scotland from ireland
 yes my cause there's quite a lot of irish in the north of england i think liverpool
 and newcastle
 and
 so on
 yes
 yes uh-huh
 no that was my m- my maternal 1 not paternal
 yeah well the same as glasgow as far as i know my my dad's parents are both well
 and truly english
 but my mum's mum was from ireland i can't remember her name
 and you've still got relatives around the dundee area oh the dundee area
 yeah aye swarming with them i think sw- swarming well my father had dundee con- strong dundee connections in the family did he have any particular words that he used that weren't that that were that sort of pinned him down as dundee rather than west coast anything that you remember that was not that i remember because different i i i don't really know dundee words to say that's a dundee 1 they're just words well they they use ken a lot did he do that ken do you ken something ken oh
 no that's up north that's peterheid you ken cause my auntie mina
 and the rest of the family use that although my mother didn't cause she'd been in england a long time
 but my auntie mina
 and them used to say ken
 but o- 1 thing when we were talking about this that appleringie thing recently which is a word i hadn't heard since childhood my mother called it appleringie
 yeah c- uh-huh uh-huh
 but dad's dad my father called it what was it flechinel flechinel
 and yet he was from the dundee area as well
 no well he wasn't the family had connections there
 but it was really clydebank he lived in all his oh right the background then right life till they got married to fill in the backstory of this cause obviously i i know what you're talking about
 but the rest of the world might not uh-huh right uh-huh it's appleringie is what southernwood or artemesia southernwood
 and the only time i'd ever heard it called appleringie was as a child it was in the garden
 and it was always appleringie i always had this it's very scented isn't it a- southernwood
 yeah aye very sort of herbally smell
 and i always used to have this
 yes picture of kind of rings of apple with the the cores core missing it always brought up the there were always sort of dried rings of apple it was always what i thought about as i say southernwood
 and then this flechinel i think we looked up flechie i can't remember what it meant
 but we looked up flechie cause you weren't sure how it was spelt don't know uh-huh aye i would spell it flechie does the flechie part of the word mean anything in particular same as me
 yeah
 but i can't remember we'd have to look at the dictionary
 yeah uh-huh right oh we'll maybe just leave it just now right aye we wo- we worked out counted how it came to be called that
 but the only other kind of scottish word i can remember that sticks in my mind when i was young was the word sleekit because i didn't even know it was scottish until i right used it in a it was an essay
 and it was i was writing about a character in something like barchester towers who was called i think it was mr slope he had the name that suggested his character uh-huh
 and i used the word sleekit
 and i got the essay back
 and there was a query beside it
 and luckily the the english teacher was scottish he was from glenrothes
 so he knew what it meant
 but i didn't
 but it's quite is it not quite common or quite well-known as a scottish word exactly
 yeah sleekit well apparently not
 no he said right well how many well it's a burns it's used in burns wee sleekit cowerin timrous beastie people in england would know much about burns
 but if they knew anything that would be the line they'd know oh hm well probably it seemed apparently it was a a word i shouldn't be using in an english essay cause it was just a scottish word
 so it stuck in my mind
 so when you moved up to scotland what did you notice any or did it come as a shock did you the first thing that happened got off the train at queen street were there words you didn't understand it would be january 19 sixty-nine oh
 no it was february how come queen street coming up from the south train
 no east coast that's where we got off oh
 yeah from uh-huh through up to edinburgh
 and then across right right edinburgh to
 and it was rag week
 and there were all these strange people on the station we wondered what we'd come to cause they were all dressed up
 and everything rag week that's why i think i thought it was january
 but maybe it was february all these weird people
 no i think it was jan-
 and then before we came once we'd applied for jobs
 and got jobs i remember there was a story in the the paper about a body found in a bin in glasgow which kind of made us think twice about it
 but we came anyway
 yeah
 and then we met in 19 seventy-one at february uh-huh can you remember where well remembered uh-huh oh the pink elephant the white
 no white elephant oh
 yeah white white elephant d- disco disco uh-huh
 yes sauchiehall street in s- sauchiehall street glasgow it later became oh i can't remember what it changed its name to it has several uh-huh is it still there or is there still a club in the same building it is there is still a club there i'm sure it was on the the first floor of a building entrance
 and we met there because we were both in the young conservatives it was a young conservatives disco isn't there a story that you you were there with a friend
 and the friend said you have the lanky 1 cause i want the other 1
 yeah or is that just the version you told me i don't think it was lanky
 no y-y- you take the big 1
 and i'll take the other 1 you take the big 1 or something
 yeah that was gordon uh-huh
 and that was pat who you were there with
 yes pat was
 yeah pat was the other 1 uh-huh
 yes
 so that was before pat met ian then it wa- oh
 yes uh-huh ian was when we went in nineteen-seventy oh
 but it was after you'd left tunbridge wells that's right
 yeah uh-huh 19 seventy-one we went down to tunbridge wells
 and she met him down there he's very english there you go
 so what was glasgow like in those days in the early seventies late sixties early seventies or what was that what was that club or disco like what was what sort of well there was 1 of these big glitter balls i remember that was that the uh-huh
 yeah uh-huh
 yeah
 and the- in the early seventies are they that old i would have put them as mid-seventies oh
 yes
 and before that another place that was popular was the m- majestic for dances known as the magic stick magic stick
 and then there was the highlanders near charing cross which was tha- very lively uh-huh that was a lively place to go on a saturday night you got dancing there you got flung around the room really i remember that
 yeah
 yeah all
 so is that sort of scottish country dancing is that is that what you did in the the the 1 in sauchiehall street sort of ceilidh stuff oh
 no
 no
 no that was as well or was that like normal
 no
 no
 no
 no disco
 no rock pop pop stuff sort of you know sort of rock
 and pop
 and stuff uh-huh
 yeah
 and
 and they all finished about ten o'clock at night
 and you got the bus home was it as early as that well we didn't from there because gordon had a car gordon i'm sure he had a car
 so did i oh that night uh-huh
 yes
 so did you aye that night well he used his mother's mini van
 but the 4 of us wouldn't get into that oh maybe that was into a mini-van how mini was the van right well i wouldn't have been sitting in the back with
 no seat there would be 2 seats in the front well like a mini car there was a van a van version of a mini car oh right right i see i thought you meant it was a van
 but ma- a small van right well it was a van just 2 windows at the front panels behind right like a a del boy there were a lot more oh it had 4 wheels uh-huh right with 4 wheels smaller than that uh-huh a mini van was smaller than that oh i don't know uh-huh it was like the mini it was a variant of the mini car there were more department stores in glasgow then big ones in sauchiehall street there was copeland
 and lye pettigrews pettigrew's
 and stephens was watt bros there at that time
 and then there was another one oh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah it still looks nineteen-seventies
 yes treron et cie where aye treron treron was up treron et cie treron ici where the et cie et cie ac right uh-huh that was up where the mclellan galleries are now known in glasgow as trero treron rather uh-huh
 and there was another 1 muirhead's or something further down on the same side as that uh-huh fraser's of course arnotts there used there were 2 fraser's fraser's
 and arnotts why were there
 so many department stores
 and lewiss that was the way of things in those days there were less there were fewer sort of chain shops big chains uh-huh
 yeah it all tended to be the big depar- which were excellent you could get anything especially copeland
 and lye i remember they used to have a good sort of haberdashery department
 and there was a a lovely restaurant it was ma brown's it was called m
 and a brown's the cake shop
 and there was a restaurant downside down the stairs from it uh-huh uh-huh ne- nearer charing cross in sauchiehall street has that not been there that was has there not been a a cake shop still
 no not ma brown-
 no it's
 no it's bradford's now it's different different right right aye it was further down uh-huh well it was probably around cause ma brown's sounds familiar while you were young uh-huh
 but it was the downstairs which aye it was 1 high tea we got there right uh-huh you might have been there for high tea 1 night possible do you want to explain the concept of a high tea i don't think that's a universal oh right oh uh-huh well it's more scottish than english i would say you don't really get high teas in england
 so you could do that one exactly
 yeah hm well it was a meal that you had around early evening consisting of often fish
 and chips a main course rather than a starter a main course certainly fish
 and chips would feature uh-huh steak pie gammon
 and pineapple like frequently in it
 yes omelette that was always an option
 and a plate of cakes oh there would be toast or bread br- bread
 and butter with it uh-huh bread
 and butter i remember from 1 in ayr
 yeah uh-huh choice of tea or coffee
 and tea or coffee with cakes which came with your meal how continental on a on a plate on a sort of uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah a tiered cake tray thing
 yeah a tiered cake plate
 yeah choice of well probably scones or usually a scone
 and a cake crumpets pancakes nice cakes could you just i i don't really remember this well i i do i remember the concept
 but i don't obviously wasn't paying for things when i was like 5
 so did you pay for what you had or did you oh right
 no just pay for the whole lot
 and you could eat them all if you wanted
 no i think
 yes that's right uh-huh
 yes oh well there was u- there was a limited amount put out like if you were at a table for
 yeah 4 there would be 4 cakes out
 and you'd ki- well
 no you'd kind of eye up deci- deciding which 1 you right right
 so you'd fight over the best one i remember doing that wanted
 and you uh-huh pineapple cake or eiffel eiffel tower fine cake fern cake a fern cake i remember down at ayr a fern cake
 yeah remember down at ayr at the was it the county hotel in the square there
 and we were there with could have been
 yes peg
 and ted from america
 and yo-
 yeah
 and i remember that
 yeah grandma was there as well right
 yeah
 and the cakes came
 and i remember there were a couple of sort of good cream cakes
 and then kind of ordinary things
 and peg
 and your mother both grabbed empire biscuits for the ce- cream cakes
 and we were left oh with the empire biscuits aye oh go- empire biscuits oh that was something my mother always called them belgian biscuits i don't know why
 but they were belgian biscuits when she made them right is that because is that because of her scottish roots or the english thing or just i don't know oh probably not cause they were always empire a quirk
 yeah biscuits up here
 but they were always belgian biscuits when i was little uh-huh stovies that's another thing stovies that's very scottish well maybe it's very dundee not around my household it wasn't
 so what did you eat in your household then that's what we had for dinner what meals do you remember from well didn't you have days of the week for things oh in those days we ha- ye-
 yes
 but fish on a friday
 no then it wa-
 no
 no
 no can i say why
 yeah well
 yeah we had fish on a tuesday because fishing boats didn't go out on a sunday night for religious reasons right for fisherman being very superstitious uh-huh
 so when they went out on a monday night back on the tuesday we got fresh fish every tuesday for tea that night hm fish was a fish is something that the roman catholics have on a friday
 yeah
 so protestant protestant households didn't why is that is it because they avoid meat or
 yeah right
 yes
 yeah have have it then see
 yes that's right what sort of fish sole haddock
 and
 yeah
 yeah oh cod or haddock was all we ever had
 no sometimes it would be a bit of it would be lemon sole nice bit of lemon sole uh-huh aye uh-huh probably cod
 and haddock would be more usual the yellowy haddock aye y-
 yes smoked dyed it could have been smok-
 yeah right is that what makes it yellow well it was
 and then we would have herring my mother would make potted herring in the summer months with herring from loch fyne is that rollmops you used to buy those in
 yes the fishmonger remember the fishmonger
 and fruit shop combined oh i can't remem- macfisheries you used to get rollmops in macfisheries you used to get rollmops in bhs in hamilton when they had a a when they had food oh uh-huh uh-huh oh
 yes probably on the deli counter
 yes uh-huh i didn't like them
 but pat used to buy them i don't think i've ever had 1 oh uh-huh well i don't think i ever had them
 but i didn't think i liked them there was there was a business in glasgow which is still there called r a mcphees who were fishing fish merchants
 and their slogan on the vans was ra- fresh from the sea to r a mcphee right there's 1 in byres road it's jack mcphee though is it not oh well it's probably the same family uh-huh right cause i was thinking they use that slogan i think
 but then uh-huh right i don't know oh
 so did it come ro- sorry did it come round in a van the fish
 no
 no that was delivering to the shops right
 so you would just go out to the shop
 and get it
 but wasn't monday always the the remains of the sunday roast that was your monday dinner
 yes boiled ham roast roast beef chicken whatever we had had over the weekend
 yeah would be used up on a monday what about puddings well uh-huh there's a lot of scottish puddings often enough custard uh-huh
 and fruit oh
 yeah home-made custard or out of bird's out of a tin oh aye bird's powdered stuff powdered custard
 and then rice pudding boiled baked r- rice sometimes though i didn't like the oh baked rice with the skin on oh oh i did i loved that brown skin skin
 and the nutmeg on it which i didn't like do you like m- nutmeg now not greatly
 no still not didn't think you had a problem with nutmeg i probably wouldn't i probably wouldn't ignore it altogether if it was there
 but did you know that
 yeah you know i wouldn't specify nutmeg on my on my rice pudding particularly there was semolina sometimes which i didn't like really
 and there would be well my mother never made things like tapioca
 and sago puddings luckily because she didn't like them either probably you know the texture of them she didn't like
 and i certainly never took to those myself can't think i can't remember what sort of thing here i heard something on radio just this morning
 and it brought back a memory e-e- you know how when you buy jelly these days to make a jelly dessert it's a jelly texture you get
 yeah tablet uh-huh it used to be crystals ah it used to be jelly crystals i remember my mother got used to make jelly aye somebody's found the last tin of creamola foam in the world crystals
 yes really uh-huh
 yeah uh-huh when did they stop making that in a shop uh-huh not very long ago i used to like creamola foam oh we had it up to the nineties i'm sure you used to like it when you were little uh-huh
 so
 yes uh-huh aye it's the factory stopped it it's only about 7 or 8 years ago apparently i think it's great stuff
 yeah we used to buy lemonade powder in woolworth's you used to buy it loose like by the it's n- made it uh-huh quarter pound or something shovel it in a bag for you you ca- i suppose it was sort of creamola foam thing
 but it was always lemonade
 yeah
 but
 and is it being sold on ebay this last tin
 no i think it's going to a museum isn't it i can't remember oh
 no somebody is buying it to try
 and crack the oh to analyse it oh the ingredients
 so that they could start making it again
 yeah although whether'll allow them to do that or not i don't know because they might still have the the rights to it well they could call it something else
 but
 yes i don't think you can have a copyright over a brand of
 no
 yeah that's what's going to happen to it well you could have rights to list of ingredients they wouldn't use the creamola foam man well coca-cola say they have
 no they would maybe need to is it simple i suppose
 but that's why they keep the ingredients secret presumably
 so that you can't copy it change the uh-huh because
 yeah
 so you know if you can analyse all the ingredients in creamola foam presumably you could do it in coca-cola
 yeah
 yeah
 but it's not done apparently if indeed there is a secret ingredient in it well maybe there isn't
 yeah do you y- sorry on you go
 no
 no i was going to say you never stayed to school lunches did you school dinners uh-huh uh-huh oh i did at high school they were something else
 no oh me
 no
 no never never once did i have a school lunch i always went home for lunch did you do you know what sorts of things people had at school lunches in those days you certainly heard stories of what they uh-huh
 yeah sago
 and tapioca for you
 and stew
 yeah i don't know if it was health-gi- healthy or not well nothing like burgers they didn't exist in those days
 no uh-huh
 but th- there was nothing well cabbage always smelt the whole school out when it was getting boiled up in the canteen school canteen cabbage does it never smelt very satisfying anyway enticing
 no the worst job was when you were on dinner duty when you had to clear the tables
 and you had to go to the slop bin with everything i remember i dropped the plate in once ew
 and it broke i didn't dare tell anybody
 yeah did you just cover it up with some more tapioca
 and urgh i would have thought every individual would have to take their own plate back to a rack
 no you had a a sort of monitor system
 and you were sort of probably on for a week
 and you were the 1 who cleared the table or something or the 1 who brought the mashed potatoes or something
 yeah cause it was brought to the table in big bins
 and the best pudding was fruit
 and shortbread used to get sort of mixed stewed fruit which was really quite nice
 and bits of shortbread
 and that was nice
 but everything else was rubbish except we used to get rice pudding with that sounds quite nice rosehip syrup
 and i liked the rosehip syrup
 so i used to have a spoonful of that
 and that was it without the rice pudding uh-huh
 and manchester tart that was do you have that
 no it was a kind of pastry base with a layer of jam
 and then cold custard on
 no never heard of it ew
 yeah it probably was
 but i just i expected not to like sc- school dinners
 so i tended not to eat them probably alright actually
 but it sounds a bit odd custard in a tart
 yeah what sort of games did you play at school at playtimes or was that before games were invented marbles or jauries they were called just tig uh-huh i can't remember what else i was at primary school when the hula hoop first came out i got a pale green one girls girls would have their ropes skipping ropes can't remember what else we might have done football
 no you wouldn't play football
 no not near all the windows in the school i didn't just stood on corners
 and talked a lot even as 6 year olds i don't know very sophisticated we were i doubt it probably remember all this afterwards when you're away well we can do it again some time i remember when pe used to be outside
 and you got these woven mats they were sort of oval mats
 and you all had to take a mat out
 and put it on the playground
 and sort of lie on it
 and do exercises
 and things as the weather was dry it wasn't comfortable
 no didn't do that if it was warm in the summer cause we did have playing fields at our primary school we would be out running races
 and doing things like that sports day
 but we never played anything like football or cricket or hockey or anything like that there was never anything organised by school for that
 no
 no not even in in pe sessions
 no did you get pe
 yes
 but then in those days it was just you just had 1 teacher for the whole year who taught academic subjects right practical subjects
 and pe
 and whatever else b- this is primary school though well i think that's that's true now is it not they weren't there weren't specialists brought in for that
 no surely you have a gym teacher
 and you have a- och you must well in secondary school we did
 no i don't well not in my day you had the same teacher for everything aye secondary school
 yes uh-huh secondary school
 yeah
 but that's very different uh-huh oh in primary you don't i i don't believe it's changed i don't know don't you get n-n- nomadic teachers what's the other word okay peripatetic peripatetic uh-huh well you do you do for things like music you do for music
 and stuff uh-huh pathe- pathetic teachers uh-huh
 yes i don't think you do for things like gym
 no you'd have to ask carol don't you i can't see carol oh we'd better not tape this don't worry we won't give her name out properly well she plays badminton with her uh-huh or she takes them for badminton right enough
 so she teaches badminton at primary well there you go which seems to be a sort of regular thing it's not an after-school activity i don't think oh was it i thought it was maybe after school uh-huh because i remember her saying today that she'd said to them certain things i have t- exactly you have to be here for
 but you know sort of badminton if you don't behave i can throw you out
 so it must be a voluntary thing ah
 but it'll just be throw them out from you know go
 and sit
 and watch you're not playing you're bad
 no
 no
 no
 no i think it was they were there of their own free will after-school time hours oh i don't know or something at lunchtime maybe i had something else i can't remember it oh
 yes i remember wh- my mother used to work in a chocolate factory in in dundee called lindsay
 and rowe i remember that what kind of chocolate did they make i don't know i just knew it was a chocolate factory it was something i kind of grew up knowing
 and she used to say it kind of put you off chocolate a bit though she did aye i was gon na ask
 yeah get her taste back for it after she left i don't remember being off it
 and my grandparents in monifieth lived in a the bottom floor of a tenement in oh well- wellside place or something i can't just remember the name i remember they used to go in a dark close
 and there's this probably doesn't exist now it was off to the right
 and there was oh there'd be a tiny wee sort of kitchen area you went through that
 and you could get out in there was a a lovely green at the back
 and the washhouses at the far end there was a flower border right up the top of the flats
 and a very old tortoise lived there called toby oh used to see him whenever i went he was reputedly about a hundred years old
 but he probably wasn't really thank you
 but oh uh-huh there was a big alright big feather bed in the corner of the sort of living room they did have a bedroom
 but there was also a big you know in the the sort of uh-huh in the recess there was a big feather bed
 yeah bed recess which was lovely
 and a little the fireplace with the sort of wee seat that you could sit beside ingle-nook is that the word is that an ingle-nook
 no just a a sort of right you used to get fireplaces with the sort of beat- built-in seats sort of at the corner like little sort of stool things
 yeah i think it's that you sit on i can't remember if it had 1 of those or not did it have a built-in toilet an indoor toilet probably not i doubt it
 but i can't actually remember that although i must have used it cause we used to go there for a week o- at a time there w-w- wouldn't be a bathroom never really visited my father's cousin who was
 no wouldn't be a bathroom at all we- well auntie mina was round the shared toilet corner in brook street
 and she had a they had an inside toilet
 but they didn't have a bathroom
 and they had a tiny wee kitchen
 so what did they have an- a tin bath to use in front of the fire we just used to get wass- washed in the kitchen at the s- kitchen sink well you when you were visiting
 but what about others
 yeah oh i don't know i don't think anyone adults who lived there
 but they were posh cause they had a front room with a piano in it it was a bedroom as well
 but uh-huh it had a a piano in it okay you used to there's 2 t- 2 lines of thought i was going along at the same time you used to have roller skates did you or roller skate plu- singular i i ha- i had roller skates
 yes was that when they were quite new i haven't a clue when roller skates were introduced oh
 no they were my cousin ian's handed down
 and ruth's after him right
 so you got them as hand-me-downs to me i had them
 yes you didn't use you didn't use them never wore 2 at once did you alternate to save the tyres
 and i didn't
 no they didn't have tyres they were metal wheels oh right ah
 no they were i think they were well rubber rubber tyres on metal
 yeah my my first ones had metal wheels i'm sure
 and they made a heck of a racket when you went down the street on them uh-huh they were certainly all all shiny metal frame with a leather strap uh-huh uh-huh with th- that nut underneath that you used to adjust the length on them
 but that was like my first pair of roller skates did to adjust them
 yeah uh-huh
 but what
 and the ones we put into the jumble sale down at the school remember we put them in aye there was there was something about it did you i remember somebody that's where mine went after i'd finished with them or uh-huh uh-huh i'm sure they did where i got them from had a a killed somebody afterwards aye i don't remember that at all
 no
 no there was something about it did they used to bend or something
 no there was something wrong with it was it was it wonky wheel or something
 but you could get new right uh-huh what you called tyres for them square uh-huh it was a sort of square wheel on it skidding to a halt
 but whether anyone would ever bother putting another uh-huh
 yeah very good for braking with
 yeah
 no that's familiar oh that kind of braking
 yes
 yes
 yeah aye well breaking your ankle probably as well
 and were were you also not 1 of the first people in scotland to have jeans oh aye what's the story quite alle-
 yes quite arguably my father's sister in america used to send over parcels maybe 2 or 3 times a year
 and i thought you got them when you were out there you you were sent them right
 no oh
 no it was long before long before that it was when i got my first two-wheeled bike bicycle that i think my ninth birthday that was ninth or tenth
 and it was just about then a parcel arrived
 and there was a pair of jeans in it for me
 and i would wear them along with a sort of cowboy shirt a checked quite warm heavy sort of shirt
 yes uh-huh well you must have stood out in rutherglen uh-huh he was used to standing out he used to go to the beach with a bow-tie on didn't you there was nobody quite like it is this get at jim night is this what it's all about
 no you did you did we were talking about it last week when we were at johnnie's the beach down the west coast of scotland is that where you day trips right
 no that was eyemouth actually where that photograph was taken
 so did you go down to down to ayr down to largs
 and
 so on when you were
 yes i gather my first holiday ever was in ayr
 yeah i was too young to remember it cause somebody my folks knew had a house in ayr right a a guest house or just they lived there right we went
 and stayed
 no just a hou- well i don't know if it was a second house or i can't remember now what it was it was their house
 and we went to stay in it
 so you stayed with them uh-huh
 no i don't think they were there they were on holiday or something they were away oh right i see right you used to go up the north east as well didn't you i thought
 no my mother
 and father did once we went to aberdeen for a holiday it was a disaster
 but oh oh i thought oh i thought you went up with them as well it was a disaster why
 no uh-huh well normally we went to arbroath more often we went to st andrews
 and we did have 1 holiday in eyemouth when i was young
 no a- aberdeen was a disaster because the daughter of the the people who had the the boarding house as it was called in those days wa- was stealing from my mother's purse which was left in the bedroom oops hm
 and the police were involved
 and all that sort of thing it rather tainted our view of aberdeen i dare say it's not all like that
 no maybe not
 but you know something happens like that
 yeah you have a a bad impression of the whole place besides i don't remember the weather being particularly good
 and it was just a big city after all it wasn't really a holiday place although it had the there's a beach the beach ballroom
 and which well which wasn't in a beach ballroom hm it's still famous in aberdeen beach ballroom oh
 yes they still got 1 oh i don't know what it's used for now
 no it's prob- uh-huh probably more a is it still a ballroom or is it like a club now a club
 but it was you know famous always been famous as the beach ba- ballroom
 no my mother
 and father once i stopped going on holidays with them went to places like up sort of the black isle area
 no it was below that aye elgin inverness sort of ellon ellon elgin ellon there was 1 place in particular nairn
 no they sort of forres toured around there from where they were based pit- new pitsligo oh
 yeah you'd been there that's where they stayed
 yeah i di- is that near peterhead isn't it up a bit well it's inland quite a bit from there
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah up in that area the north east buchan
 but you used to get your meals included didn't you alth- it was a boarding house
 and you used to get all your meals well you had either full-board or half-board or you had attendance in the sort of early years after the war what do you mean by attendance the landlady cooked your own food for you i suppose it w- was down to rationing right
 yeah
 and landladies couldn't go out
 and buy what they needed for
 yeah uh-huh all their boarders
 so you took your own coupons you got well you either got right your own food
 and brought it in or you gave the coupons to the landlady
 and she went
 and registered them at uh-huh her own butcher
 and grocer
 and whoever uh-huh
 and
 so in effect it was your food
 and she just made it for you
 yeah bizarre i didn't know that
 but aye well that was because of the war pa- post-war the post-war years
 and rationing still being a feature
 yeah did you holiday much in scotland when you were young before you moved up here well dundee well
 yes in that relatives uh-huh monifieth was the the usual place used to come up usually just with my mum my dad would be working bu- apart from that the first holiday i remember was in redcar in a caravan i think it rained all week
 and i remember buying a little sheila that's my sister
 and i were there
 and we bought little ornaments
 and 1 was a little sort of woman with a barrel beside her you kept matches in
 and the other w- had a little sort of apron on
 and it changed colour blue when it was going to rain
 and pink when it was going to be dry or something
 and i remember they used to be in the the sort of display cupboard bit at home
 and i broke 1 of them 1 day
 and i remember i i hid the bits in the sugar bowl
 and i hoped they would never be found
 and eventually they were i was kind of hoping nobody would ever use the sugar
 and they wouldn't miss them didn't know anything about it when they were found i take it you didn't get away with it
 yeah
 no i think they suspected me
 and apart from that we used to go to whitby cause a a mate of my dad's at work had a caravan
 and he used to to drive us through to the caravan site there or we'd go to scarborough because there was cricket there
 and my dad liked the cricket to play or just to watch
 no
 no
 no he just watched
 but monifieth was sort of the the place i came to mu- most often was there much there really no-
 no is there much there now the- there's probably more now well certainly more houses
 but y- you just some of came
 and sort of visited relatives
 and
 and went to the beach played all on the beach
 and i remember visiting my cousin she was in the school on the main s- on the high street in monifieth
 and we went along 1 day at playtime
 and spoke through the railings to her like being at the zoo
 yeah i do- i don't remember there being anything on the beach except you used to collect shells uh-huh
 and further along you would only be able to go
 so far along because it was barry budden which was was that an army camp or something uh-huh it was a camp
 and then the other way was broughty ferry which was where my mum
 and dad had met because my dad was stationed there in the army right
 so they met through that shall we stop there
 and are you d- about to say something carry on if that's probably you you do i was gon na ask mother a question how long was he there in the army cause he was abroad as well wasn't he oh
 yes he was abroad during the war uh-huh he joined the army early sudan he gave a false birthday
 so he always reckoned he had 2 birthdays like the queen i can't remember what age
 and paddington he was when he joined
 but i've got his papers
 and things upstairs somewhere he was in he must have been stationed up there before he was sent abroad why broughty ferry or before just cause it's sort of out of the way
 and th- i suppose it was popular as a training place relatively unpopulated i suppose dundee was an ind- heavy industry in dundee maybe they were right
 and in fact well my mum lived there after sheila was born in 19 thirty-nine
 and my dad must have gone abroad then or shortly after then i can't remember if he was abroad when she was born i don't think
 so
 and my mum lived with her parents in monifieth for a while
 and then when they moved south sheila can remember they lived with my my gran that's my dad's mother in stockton cause she remembers it it was a a dark house
 and she was scared going upstairs cause it was dark
 and everything she didn't like it there
 and then by the time i was born we'd moved to norton cause i was 8 years younger yep still am yep baby boomer a baby boomer well
 no it was really the year before cause the year above us at school had an extra stream in it because there was
 so many it was really i thought from forty-six onwards baby boom time well
 yeah
 but well uh-huh building up to it it must have slackened off a bit after the first boom uh-huh
 but we used to have lots of sort of postcards
 and things that my dad sent
 and photographs he sent sent home where in particular was he abroad if you remember he was in india
 and i'm sure he was in africa as well
 but india i remember
 and i remember pictures of him with a horse well
 and he was a gunner pictures of him standing beside his big gun he had a sort of does it like cannon thing tell you on the medals you've got which campaigns they were it will do uh-huh i'm sure it will uh-huh
 but he was certainly in india cause i remember hearing about it aye
 and then he n- he didn't want to travel after that he said he'd travelled enough during the war
 so he was never interested in going anywhere okay will we stop there okay
