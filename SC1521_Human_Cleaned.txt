 but f718 she considered herself to be scottish even wasn't actually born here m1078 aye grandparents would be f718 what did they do m1078 well my grandfather died before my mother was born f718 if you can remember right f1077 m1078 actually
 so i think he was an armature winder f718 he was a what m1078 armature winder f718 what's an armature winder m1078 somebody who winds armatures like for f718 right what's an armature f1077 big coils isn't that of a motor part of an electric motor m1078 is electrical coil on a f718 right of aware of the word
 but i didn't know what it f1077 m1078 in those days women didn't work
 but f718 m1078 when my grandfather was my grandmother was widowed she opened a shop near celtic park actually sweets f718 m1078
 and such like i'm told f718 m1078 all my all 4 of my grandparents were deceased before i was born f718 right m1078 i never knew any of them f718 f1077 actually had an an irish m1078 f1077 i m1078 had you had f1077 maternal grandmother was of irish stock m1078 f1077 i can't actually remember her her name at the moment
 but it was she came over they came over from ireland f718
 so they came over to scotland from ireland f1077 yes f718 there's quite a lot of irish in the north of england i think
 and newcastle
 and
 so on yes f1077 no that was my my maternal 1 not paternal m1078 well the same as glasgow f1077 as far as i know my my dad's parents are both well
 and truly english
 but my mum's mum was from ireland i can't remember her name f718
 and you've still got relatives around the area f1077 the dundee yeah aye swarming with them i think f718 swarming m1078 well my father had dundee strong dundee connections f718 f1077 f718 m1078 the f718 did he have any particular words that he used that weren't that that were that sort of pinned him down as dundee rather than west coast that you remember that m1078 that i remember because f718 m1078 i i i don't really know dundee words to that's a dundee 1 they're just f1077 they they use'ken a lot did he do that do you ken something f718 m1078 ken oh no that's up north that's ken f1077 my auntie mina the rest of the family use that although my mother didn't cause she'd been in england a long time
 but my auntie mina
 and them used to say ken m1078 f1077
 but 1 thing when we were talking about this that appleringie thing recently which is a word i hadn't heard since childhood mother called it f718 f1077 dad's dad m1078 my father f1077 called it what was it m1078 flechinel f1077 flechinel
 and yet he was from the dundee area f718 m1078 well he wasn't the connections there
 but it was really clydebank he lived in all f1077 right the background then f718 m1078 till they got f718 to fill in the backstory of this cause obviously i i know what're talking about
 but the rest of the world might not f1077 it's f718 is what f1077 or m1078 f1077
 and the only time i'd ever heard it called appleringie was as a child it was in the garden
 and it was always appleringie always had f718's very scented isn't it f1077 very sort of herbally smell
 and i always used to have m1078 f1077 picture of kind of rings of apple with the f718 f1077 core missing it always brought up the there were always of dried rings of apple it was always what i thought f718 f1077 m1078 f1077 i say southernwood
 and then this flechinel i think we looked up'flechie i can't remember what it meant
 but we looked up'flechie you weren't sure how it was f718 m1078 don't know f1077 aye i would spell it f718 the'flechie part of the word mean anything in particular m1078 as f1077 yeah
 but i can't remember we'd have to look at the dictionary f718 oh we'll maybe just leave it just now f1077 we we worked out counted how it came to be called
 but the only other kind of scottish word i can remember that sticks in my mind when i was young was the word'sleekit because i didn't even know it was scottish f718 f1077 used it in a it was an essay
 and it was i was writing about a character in something like barchester towers who was called i think it was mr slope he had the name that suggested his character f718 f1077
 and i used the word'sleekit
 and i got the essay back
 and there was a query beside it f718 f1077 luckily the the english teacher was scottish he was from glenrothes
 so he knew what it i f718 it's quite is it not quite common as a scottish word exactly yeah f1077 apparently not no he said right well how m1078 it's a burns it's used in burns wee sleekit cowerin timrous beastie f1077 people in england would know much about burns f718 if they knew anything that would be the line they'd m1078 f1077 hm f718 f1077 seemed apparently it was a a word i shouldn't be using in an english essay cause it was just a scottish it stuck in my f718
 so when you moved up to scotland what did you notice any or did it come as a shock f1077 first thing that happened got off the train at queen f718 there words you didn't understand f1077 would be january 19 oh no it was f718 come queen street up from the south m1078 east f1077's where we got off oh yeah from up to edinburgh
 and then across f718 m1078 f1077
 and it was rag week f718 f1077 there were all these strange people on the station we wondered what we'd come to were all dressed up
 and m1078 rag f1077 that's why i think i thought it was january
 but maybe it was february all these weird m1078 i think it was f1077
 and then before we came once we'd applied for jobs
 and got jobs i remember there was a story in the the paper about a body found in a bin in glasgow f718 f1077 which kind of made us think twice about it
 but we came f718 yeah f1077
 and then we met in 19 at m1078 february f1077 you remember where f718 remembered m1078 oh the pink elephant f1077 f718 m1078 oh white white f718 m1078 disco f1077 disco f718 f1077 sauchiehall m1078 sauchiehall street f1077 it later became oh i can't remember what it changed its name to has m1078 f718 it still there or is there still a club in the same building f1077 is there is still a club there i'm sure it was on the the first floor of a building
 and we met there because we were both in the young conservatives it was a young conservatives disco f718 isn't there a story that you you were there with a
 and the friend said you have the lanky 1 cause i want the other 1 f1077 m1078 f718 is that just the version you told me f1077 don't think it was m1078 no you take the big 1
 and i'll take the other 1 f718 f1077 you take the big 1 or something yeah that was gordon f718
 and that was pat you were there with f1077 pat was yeah pat was the other 1 m1078 f718 that was before pat met ian then f1077 yes ian was when we went in m1078
 but it was after you'd left wells that's right f1077 19 we went down tunbridge wells
 and she met him down there f718 f1077 he's very english f718 there you go
 so what was glasgow like in those days in the early seventies late sixties early seventies or what was that what was that club or disco like what was what sort of f1077 well there was 1 of these big glitter balls i remember that that the yeah yeah
 and f718 the early seventies are they that old i would have put them as m1078 oh yes
 and before f1077 another place that was popular was the majestic for f718 m1078 known as the magic stick f718 f1077
 and then there was the highlanders near charing cross was very lively m1078 was a lively place to go on a saturday f1077 you got dancing there you got flung around the room really remember that yeah yeah f718 is that sort of scottish country dancing that is that what you did in the the the 1 in sauchiehall f1077 of ceilidh no no no that f718 well or was that like normal m1078 no no no rock f718 stuff f1077 of you know sort of rock

 and stuff m1078 they all finishedo'clock at night
 and you got the bus f718 f1077 it as early as that well we didn't from there because gordon had a car gordon'm sure he had a m1078 did that night f1077
 so did you aye that night m1078 well he used his mother's mini van
 but 4 of us wouldn't get into f1077 maybe that f718 into a m1078 f718 how mini was the van f1077 i wouldn't have been sitting in the back with no seat there would be 2 seats in the front m1078 like a mini car there was a van a van version of a f718 right right i i thought you meant it was a van
 but small van m1078 it was a van just 2 windows at the front panels behind f718 like a a del boy f1077 were a lot it had 4 wheels f718 m1078 4 wheels smaller than that a mini van was smaller than f718 oh i don't know m1078 was like the mini it was a variant of the mini f1077 there were more department stores in glasgow then big ones f718 f1077 street there was copeland
 and lye m1078's
 and f718 watt bros there at that time f1077 then there was another yeah yeah f718 still looks m1078 treron et cie f718 f1077 treron was m1078 et f718 ici f1077 m1078 et f718 f1077 that was the mclellan galleries are m1078 in glasgow as trero f1077 there was another 1 muirhead's or something further down on the same side as m1078's of course f1077 there used there were 2 fraser's's
 and f718 were there
 so many department stores m1078 was the way of things in those f1077 there were less there were fewer of f718 shops m1078 f718 f1077 yeah it all tended to be the big which were excellent you could get anything especially copeland
 and lye i remember they used to have a good sort of haberdashery department f718 f1077
 and there was a a lovely restaurant it was ma brown's it was called m
 and a brown's the cake shop
 and there was a restaurant downside the stairs from it m1078 nearer charing cross in sauchiehall f718 that not been f1077 was f718 has there not been a a cake shop f1077 ma no it's m1078 it's bradford's's different f718 f1077 it was further down well it was probably f718 ma brown's sounds m1078 f1077 while you were young f718 f1077 it was the downstairs which aye it was 1 high tea we got f718 m1078 you might have been there for high tea 1 night f718 do you want to explain the concept of a high tea i don't think that's f1077 right oh well it's more scottish than english i would say you don't really get teas in england
 so you could do that f718 m1078 hm well it was a meal that you had around early evening f718 f1077 m1078 consisting of often fish
 and f718 f1077 main course rather than a f718 m1078 a main certainly fish
 and chips would feature f1077 pie gammon
 and f718 m1078 frequently in f718 f1077 omelette was always an f718 m1078 a plate of oh there would be toast bread bread
 and butter with it f718
 and butter i remember from 1 in ayr f1077 of tea or coffee m1078 or coffee with f1077 came with your f718 how continental m1078 a on a plate a sort f1077 yeah f718 tiered cake tray thing m1078 tiered cake f718 yeah m1078 choice of probably scones f1077 a scone
 and a m1078 crumpets pancakes nice f718 you just i i don't really remember this well i i do i remember the concept
 but i don't obviously wasn't paying for things when i was like 5
 so did you pay for what you had or did f1077 oh f718 pay for the whole lot
 and you could eat them all if you wanted m1078 i think yes that's f1077 well there was there was a limited amount put if you were at a table f718 f1077 4 there would be 4 cakes out
 and you'd well no you'd kind of eye up deciding which 1 f718 right
 so you'd fight over the best remember doing that f1077
 and you m1078 cake eiffel tower fine f718 cake a fern cake f1077 remember down at ayr a fern cake down at ayr m1078 f1077 at the was it the county hotel in the square there we were there m1078 have f1077
 and ted from yeah f718 remember that yeah f1077 was there as well m1078 f718 f1077 the cakes came
 and i remember there were a couple of sort of good cream cakes
 and then kind of ordinary things peg
 and your mother both f718 f1077 the cream cakes
 and we were left m1078 f718 the empire biscuits f1077 oh empire that was something my mother always called them belgian biscuits i don't know why
 but they were belgian biscuits when she made f718 right that because is that because of her scottish roots or the english thing or f1077 don't probably not cause they were always f718 f1077 up here
 but they were always belgian biscuits when i was f718 f1077 stovies that's another thing stovies that's very scottish well maybe it's very m1078 around my household it wasn't f718 what did you eat in your household then f1077's what we had for f718 what meals do you remember from f1077 didn't you have days of the week for things m1078 in those days we f718 on a friday no m1078 it no no can i say why f718 f1077 yeah f718 m1078 had fish on a tuesday because fishing boats didn't go out on a sunday night religious reasons f718 m1078 fisherman being very f718 m1078
 so when they went out on a monday night back on the tuesday we got fresh fish every tuesday for tea that night f718 hm m1078 fish was a fish is something that the roman catholics have on a friday f718 yeah m1078 protestant protestant households f718 is that is it because they avoid meat yeah right f1077 m1078 have it then see that's f718 f1077 f718 what sort of fish m1078 sole
 and f718 f1077 cod or haddock was all we ever m1078 no sometimes it would be a bit of it would be lemon sole bit of lemon f718 f1077 f718 m1078 probably cod
 and be more f718 the yellowy haddock m1078 aye yes smoked it could have been f718 yeah right is that what makes it yellow f1077 it was m1078 then we would herring my mother would make potted herring in the summer months herring f718 m1078 from loch fyne f718 f1077 that rollmops used to buy those m1078 yes f1077 the fishmonger remember the fishmonger
 and fruit shop combined i can't macfisheries f718 used to get rollmops in macfisheries you used to get rollmops in in hamilton when they had a when they had f1077 m1078 yes probably on the deli counter yes f1077 i didn't like them
 but pat used to buy them f718 i don't think i've ever had 1 f1077 oh i don't think i ever had them
 but i didn't think i liked f718 m1078 there was a business in glasgow which is still there called mcphees who were fishing fish merchants their slogan on the vans was fresh from the sea to mcphee f718 f1077 f718 right f1077 there's 1 in byres road f718's jack mcphee though is it not f1077 oh well it's probably the same family f718 cause i was thinking they use that slogan i think
 but then m1078 i don't know oh f718
 so did it come sorry did it come round in a van the fish m1078 no no that was delivering to the shops f718
 so you would just go out to the shop
 and get it f1077
 but wasn't monday always the the remains of the sunday roast was your monday dinner m1078 boiled ham roast beef f718 m1078 chicken whatever we had had the f718 m1078 would be used up on a monday f718 about puddings f1077 m1078 f718's a lot of scottish m1078 often enough custard f718 m1078
 and fruit oh yeah f718 custard or out of bird's out of a tin m1078 oh aye bird's f718 m1078
 and then rice pudding boiled baked rice sometimes though i didn't like f1077 baked rice with the skin on oh i did i loved that brown f718 m1078
 and the nutmeg on it which i didn't f718 you like nutmeg now m1078 greatly f718 not didn't think you had a problem with m1078 probably wouldn't i probably wouldn't ignore it altogether if it was there f718 you know that m1078 you know i wouldn't specify nutmeg on my my rice f718 m1078 particularly there was semolina sometimes which i didn't like really
 and there would be well my mother never made things like tapioca
 and sago f718 m1078 puddings f718 m1078 luckily f718 because she didn't like them either m1078 you know the texture of them she didn't i certainly never took to those f718 m1078n't f1077 can't remember what sort of m1078 here i heard something on radio just this morning
 and it brought back a memory you know how when you buy jelly these days to make a jelly it's a jelly texture you get f1077 tablet used to be crystals m1078 it used to be jelly remember my mother got used to make f1077 aye's found the last tin of creamola foam in the m1078 f718 f1077 f718 did they stop making that m1078 a not very long f718 used to like creamola foam oh we had it up to the nineties i'm f1077 used to like it when you were little m1078 it's the factory stopped it it's only about 7 or 8 years ago f718 think it's great stuff f1077 used to buy lemonade powder in woolworth's you used to buy it loose like by m1078's made f718 f1077 pound or shovel it in a bag for you you i suppose it was sort of creamola foam thing
 but it was always lemonade f718 yeah f1077 m1078 f718
 and is it being sold on ebay this last tin f1077 m1078 i think it's going to a museum isn't it f1077 i can't remember m1078 oh no somebody is buying it to try crack f1077 to analyse it f718 m1078 ingredients
 so that they could start making it f718 m1078 although whether'll allow them to do that or not i don't know they might still have the the rights to f718 f1077 well they could call it something else m1078
 but f718 yes don't think you can have a copyright over a brand of f1077 m1078 that's what's going to happen to you could have rights to f718 of f1077 wouldn't use the creamola foam m1078 say they they would maybe need f1077 it simple i f718
 but that's why they keep the ingredients secret presumably
 so that you can't copy m1078 the f718 because yeah f1077 m1078
 so you know if you can analyse all ingredients in creamola foam presumably you could do it in f718 f1077 f718 m1078 it's not done apparently indeed there is a secret ingredient in f718 maybe there isn't m1078 f718 you sorry on you f1077 no no i was going to say you never stayed to school lunches did you dinners oh i did at high school they were something m1078 oh me no no never never once did i have a school i always went home for lunch f718 did you do you know what sorts of things people had at school lunches in those days m1078 you certainly heard stories of what they f718 f1077 sago
 and tapioca for m1078
 and stew f718 f1077 m1078 i don't know if it was healthy or not well nothing like burgers they didn't exist in those f718 f1077 m1078
 but there was nothing well cabbage always smelt the whole school out it was getting boiled up in the canteen school f718 f1077 cabbage m1078 it never smelt very satisfying anyway f718 f1077 worst job when you were on dinner duty when you had to clear the tables
 and you had to go to the slop bin with everything remember i dropped the plate in f718 f1077 it broke i didn't dare tell f718 you just cover it up with some more tapioca
 and f1077 m1078 would have thought every individual would have to take their back to a f1077 you had a a sort of monitor system you were sort of probably on for a week
 and you were the 1 who cleared the table or something or the 1 who brought the mashed potatoes or m1078 f1077 cause it was brought to the table in big bins
 and the best pudding was fruit
 and shortbread to get sort of mixed stewed fruit which was really quite nice f718 f1077 bits of shortbread
 and that was nice
 but everything else was rubbish we used to get rice pudding f718 sounds quite f1077 rosehip syrup f718 f1077
 and i liked the rosehip syrup
 so i used to have a spoonful of that
 and that was it the rice f718 f1077
 and manchester tart that was do you have that it was a kind of pastry base with a layer of jam
 and then cold custard f718 m1078 never heard of it f718 ew f1077 yeah probably was
 but i just i expected not to like school dinners
 so i tended not to eat f718 alright actually
 but it sounds a bit odd custard in a tart sort of games did you play at school f1077 f718 at playtimes was that before games were invented m1078 or jauries they were called just tig f718 m1078 i can't remember else f1077 was at primary school when the hula hoop first came f718 f1077 got a pale green m1078 girls would have their ropes f718 f1077 m1078 what else we might have f1077 no you wouldn't play m1078 no not near all the windows in the school f1077 on corners
 and talked f718 m1078 f1077 a lot m1078 even as 6 year olds i don't f718 f1077 m1078 very sophisticated we were f1077 i doubt it m1078 probably remember all this afterwards when you're away f718 well we can do it again some time m1078 f1077 i remember when used to be outside
 and you got these woven mats they were sort of oval mats
 and you all had to take a mat out
 and put it on the playground
 and sort of lie on it
 and do exercises
 and things as the weather was dry wasn't m1078 didn't do if it was warm in the summer cause we did have playing fields at our school f718 m1078 we would be out races f1077 m1078 doing things like that f1077 sports day m1078
 but we never played anything like football or cricket or hockey or anything like that there was never anything organised f718 m1078 by school that no f718 even in in sessions no did you get m1078 yes
 but then in those days it was just you just had 1 teacher for the whole year f718 m1078 who taught subjects f718 m1078 practical subjects
 and
 and whatever else f718 is primary school though well i think that's that's true now is it not f1077 weren't m1078 weren't specialists brought in for surely you have a gym teacher
 and you have och you must well in secondary school we f718 i don't well not in my day you had the same teacher for f1077 secondary school yes f718 school yeah
 but that's very m1078 oh primary you f1077 f718 i don't believe it's m1078 don't know don't you get nomadic teachers what's the other f718 f1077 well you do you do for things like music f718 do for music
 and stuff m1078 pathetic teachers f718 don't think you do for things like f1077 you'd have to ask m1078n't you f718 m1078 i can't see carol oh we'd better not tape this f718 f1077 f718n't worry we won't give her name out m1078 f718 f1077 m1078 well she plays badminton with her f718 m1078 or she takes them for badminton right enough she teaches badminton at primary f718 f1077 f718 there you go m1078 seems to be a sort of regular it's not an activity i don't f1077 was it i thought it was maybe after because i remember her saying today that she'd said to them certain things i have m1078 f1077 to be here for
 but you know sort of badminton if you don't behave i can throw you out f718 f1077 it must be a voluntary m1078
 but it'll just be throw them out you know go
 and sit
 and watch you're not playing you're bad f1077 no no no no i think it was m1078 f1077 were there of their own free will f718 m1078 time i don't know f1077 something at lunchtime i had something else i can't remember it oh yes i remember my mother used to work in a chocolate factory in in dundee called lindsay
 and rowe i remember that f718 what kind of chocolate did they make f1077 i don't know i just knew it was a chocolate factory it was something i kind of grew up knowing she f718 f1077 to say it kind of put you off chocolate a though she f718 i was gon na ask f1077 get her taste back for it after she left don't remember being off it f718 f1077
 and my grandparents in monifieth lived in a the bottom floor of a tenement in oh wellside place or something i can't just remember the name remember they used to go in a dark close
 and there's m1078 doesn't exist f1077 it was off to the right
 and there was oh there'd be a tiny wee sort of kitchen area went through that
 and you could get f718 f1077 in there was a a lovely green at the back
 and the washhouses at the far end there was a flower border right up the top of the flats
 and a very old tortoise lived there f718 f1077 to see him whenever i went he was reputedly about a hundred years old
 but he probably wasn't m1078 f718 thank you f1077
 but oh was a m1078 alright f1077 big feather bed in the corner of the sort of living room they did have a bedroom
 but there was also a big you know in the sort of in the recess there was a big feather bed f718 m1078 f1077 which was lovely
 and a little the fireplace with the sort of wee seat that you could sit beside f718 is that the word that an f1077 just a a sort f718 f1077 you used to get fireplaces with the sort of m1078 f1077 seats sort of at the corner little sort of stool f718 f1077 i think it's that you sit on i can't remember if it had 1 of those or not f718 did it have a toilet an indoor toilet f1077 probably not i doubt it
 but i can't actually f718 f1077 although i must have used it cause we used to go there for a week at a time wouldn't be a m1078 really visited my father's cousin who f1077 no wouldn't be a bathroom at all f718 f1077 auntie mina was round f718 toilet f1077 corner in brook street
 and she had a they had an inside toilet
 but they didn't have a bathroom they had a tiny wee f718 m1078 what did they have f1077 m1078 a tin bath to use in front of the fire f1077 we just used to get washed in the kitchen at the kitchen sink m1078 well you when you were visiting
 but about others f1077 i don't know i don't think m1078 who lived there f1077
 but they were posh cause they had a front room with a piano in it was a bedroom as well f718 f1077 it had a a piano in it f718 okay you used to there's 2 2 lines of thought i was going along at the same time you used to have roller skates did you or roller skate singular f1077 m1078 i i roller skates f718 that when they quite new i haven't a clue when skates were m1078 no they were my's handed down
 and ruth's after him f718
 so you got them as m1078 to me i had them f718 didn't f1077 didn't use m1078 never wore 2 at f718 f1077 f718 did you alternate save the tyres m1078 i didn't f1077 they didn't have tyres they were metal wheels f718 oh right f1077 m1078 they were i think they were well tyres on f1077 my my first ones had metal wheels
 and they made a heck of a racket when you went down the street on f718 m1078 were certainly all all shiny frame a leather f718 f1077 that nut underneath that you used to adjust the length on f718 m1078 f718 that was like my first pair of roller did to adjust f1077 m1078
 but f718 f1077 the ones we put into the jumble sale down at the we put them in aye there was there was something about f718 you f1077 i remember f718's where mine went after i'd them f1077'm sure they f718 i got them from f1077 a m1078 somebody f718 i don't remember that at f1077 there was something about it did they used to bend or something no there was something wrong with it was it was it wonky wheel or something
 but you could get new f718 right f1077 you called tyres for m1078 f1077 it was a sort of square wheel on it f718 m1078 to a f1077
 but whether anyone would ever bother putting another very good for braking f718 no that's f1077 m1078 oh that kind of braking f718 f1077 aye well f718 breaking your ankle probably as well f1077 f718 were were you also not 1 of the first people in scotland to have jeans m1078 f1077 oh aye f718's the story m1078 quite yes quite arguably f718 f1077 m1078 my father's sister in america f718 m1078 used to send over parcels maybe 2 or 3 times a year f718 thought you got them when you were out there you were sent them right m1078 oh no it was long before long before it was when i got my first bike f718 m1078 bicycle that i think my ninth birthday that was ninth or tenth
 and it was just about then a parcel arrived
 and there was a pair of jeans in it f718 m1078
 and i would wear them along with a sort of cowboy shirt checked f718 m1078 warm heavy sort of well f718 must have stood out in rutherglen f1077 was used to standing out he used to go to the beach with a on didn't you m1078 was nobody quite like f718 f1077 f718 m1078 this get at jim night this what it's all about f718 f1077 you you did we were talking about it last week when we were at johnnie's f718 the beach down the west coast of scotland that where you day trips right m1078 that was eyemouth actually where that photograph was f718
 so did you go down to down to ayr down to largs
 so on when you m1078 gather my first holiday ever was in f718 f1077 m1078 too young to remember it cause somebody my folks knew had a house in ayr f718 right a guest house or just they lived there m1078 went
 and stayed no just a well i don't know if it was a second house i can't remember now what it was it was their house
 and we went to stay in f718 you stayed with them m1078 no i don't think they were there were on holiday or something they were f718 right i see f1077 you used to go up the north east as well didn't you m1078 my mother
 and father we went to aberdeen for a holiday it was a disaster
 but f1077 oh i thought oh i thought you went up with them as f718 was a disaster why m1078 well normally we went to arbroath f718 m1078 more often we went to st andrews we did have 1 holiday in f718 m1078 when i was young no aberdeen was a disaster because the daughter of the the people who had the the boarding house it was called in those days f718 m1078 was stealing from my mother's purse which was left in f718 f1077 m1078
 and the police were involved
 and all that sort of thing it rather tainted our view of aberdeen f718 f1077 f718 i dare say it's not all like that m1078 no maybe not
 but you know something happens like f718 f1077 m1078 you have a a bad impression of the whole place f718 m1078 besides i don't remember the weather being particularly good
 and it was just a big city after all it wasn't really a holiday place it had f718 f1077's a m1078 beach ballroom
 and which well which wasn't in f718 ballroom m1078 hm it's still famous in beach ballroom oh f718 still got 1 m1078 don't know what it's used for now no it's probably more f718 it still a ballroom or is it like a club now m1078 a club
 but it was you know famous always been famous as beach f718 m1078 no my mother
 and father f718 m1078 once i stopped going on holidays with them went to places like f1077 up sort of the black isle area m1078 no it was below that f1077 inverness m1078 sort of ellon ellon elgin ellon there was 1 place in f1077 m1078 no sort f718 f1077 m1078 around there from where they were new f718 f1077 you'd been m1078's where they f718 i f1077 f718 that near peterhead isn't it up a bit m1078 it's inland quite a bit from there f718 yeah yeah yeah yeah m1078 up in that area north f718 f1077 m1078 f1077
 but you used to get your meals included didn't you it was a boarding house
 and you used to get all your meals m1078 well you had either or f718 m1078 or you had attendance in the sort of early years after the war f718 what do you mean by'attendance m1078 the landlady cooked your own food for you suppose it was down to f718 f1077 f718 m1078 landladies couldn't go out
 and buy they needed f718 m1078 their
 so you took your own coupons you got well either f718 m1078 your own food
 and brought it in or you gave the coupons to the landlady
 and she went registered them f718 m1078 her own
 and grocer
 and f718 m1078
 and
 so in effect it was your food she just made it for f718 f1077 f718 didn't know m1078 aye well that was because of the war the years
 and rationing still being a f718 did you holiday much in scotland when you were young before you moved up here dundee f1077 yes in that relatives monifieth was the the usual f718 f1077 used to come up usually just with my mum my dad would be working f718 f1077 apart from that the first holiday i remember was in redcar in a caravan i think it rained f718 f1077
 and i remember buying a little sheila that's my sister
 and i were there
 and we bought little ornaments
 and 1 was a little sort of woman with a barrel beside her you kept matches in
 and the other had a little sort of apron on
 and it changed colour blue when it was going to rain
 and pink when it was going to be dry or something
 and i remember they used to be in the the sort of display cupboard bit at home i broke 1 of them 1 f718 f1077
 and i remember i i hid the bits in the sugar bowl
 and i hoped they would be found
 and eventually they f718 f1077 was kind of hoping nobody would ever use f718 f1077
 and they wouldn't miss them didn't know anything about it when they were found f718 i take it you didn't get away with it f1077 i think they suspected
 and apart from that we used to go to f718 f1077 cause a a mate of my dad's at work had a caravan
 and he used to to drive us through to the caravan site there f718 f1077 or we'd go to scarborough because there was cricket there
 and my dad liked the cricket f718 to play or just to watch f1077 no no he just f718 f1077
 but monifieth was sort of the the place i came to most often f718 there much there really f1077 f718 is there much there now m1078 f1077 there's probably more now f718 f1077 certainly more houses f718 f1077 you just some of came
 and sort of visited relatives
 and went to the beach f718 f1077 played all on the beach
 and i remember visiting my cousin she was in the school on the main on the high street in monifieth
 and we went along 1 day at playtime
 and spoke through the railings to her like being at the zoo f718 f1077 i i don't remember there being anything on the beach except you used to collect shells f718 f1077
 and further along you would only be able to go
 so far along because it was barry budden which was was that an army or something m1078 it was a f718 f1077 then the other way broughty ferry which was where my mum
 and dad had met because my dad was stationed there in the army f718 f1077
 so they met through that f718 we stop there m1078 f718 you about to say something carry on f1077 that's f718 you m1078 was gon na mother a question f1077 m1078 how long was he there in the army cause he was abroad as well wasn't he f718 f1077 yes he was during the war he joined the army m1078 f1077 he gave a false birthday
 so he always reckoned he had 2 birthdays like the queen i can't remember what f718
 and f1077 he was when he joined
 but i've got his papers
 and things upstairs somewhere he was in he must have been stationed up there before he was sent abroad f718 broughty ferry m1078 or f718 cause it's sort of out of the way
 and f1077 suppose it was popular as a training place f718 unpopulated m1078 suppose dundee was an heavy industry in dundee maybe they f718 right f1077 in fact well my mum lived there after sheila was born in 19 m1078 f1077
 and my dad must have gone abroad then or shortly after then f718 m1078 f1077 i can't remember if he was abroad when she was born i don't think
 so
 and my mum lived with her parents in monifieth a f718 f1077 then when they moved south sheila can remember they lived with my my gran that's my dad's mother in stockton m1078 f1077 cause she remembers it it was a a dark house
 and she was scared going upstairs cause it was dark
 and everything she didn't like it there
 and then by the time i was born we'd moved to norton cause i was 8 years younger f718 yep f1077 still am f718 yep m1078 baby boomer f1077 m1078 a baby boomer f1077 well no it was really the year before cause the year above us at school had an extra stream in it because there was m1078 f1077 it was really m1078 i thought from onwards boom f1077 yeah
 but m1078 up to f718 f1077 must have slackened off a bit after the first boom f718 f1077
 but we used to have lots of sort of postcards
 and things that my dad sent
 and photographs he sent sent home m1078 in particular was he abroad you remember f1077 was in m1078 f1077
 and i'm sure he was in africa as m1078 f1077
 but india i remember
 and i remember pictures of him with a m1078 f1077
 and he was a gunner pictures of him standing beside his big gun he had a sort of m1078 f1077 cannon f718 m1078 you on the medals you've got campaigns they were f1077 will do i'm sure it will
 but he was certainly in india cause i remember hearing about it aye
 and then he he didn't want to travel after that he said he'd travelled enough during the war
 so he was never interested in going anywhere f718 okay we stop there f1077 this work is protected by copyright all rights reserved the scots project
