 ok
 well tell me about if you can your first day at school you must remember i'm dressed up in uniform i don't have that many memories from kind of as far as maybe 809 i mean there's certain things that will stick put certain things that you look back on
 and see as being significant your first day at school aren't significant at the time really that if you've kind of been through nursery it's just more going off
 and seeing a lot of the same people you'd seen the nursery pretty much
 so i genuinely have
 no idea about first day at school kind of earliest memory earliest couple of memories we'd have to be first 1 is from when i was being in front of the tv
 and seeing the thrill of michael jackson i never always can't been quite musical
 so for something that was
 so musically intense
 and had all the elements kind of the dancing going on as
 well that was kind of staggering for 2 year old
 and even now it in my opinion it it leads the way in music videos
 and is the best music video of all time
 and you know partially due to the elements of the dark side as it were kind of for 2 year old that's fairly exciting ok
 so that that's certainly 1 of them
 and another is just kind of a general picture of being a nursery that i can't really put faces to the picture i guess
 but i just have the elements of knowing that i can remember being there
 and i can remember the fact that it was a pair of twins i can't remember who they were at all
 but i know they were there
 and there was a slide
 and things like that it's all kind of fairly there's certain aspects of it where it is fairly clear the picture
 but then other bits which just kind of blow into the background it's kind of a photograph where you focused in on 1 point
 and all others get fuzzed out a bit
 yeah i remember whacking my son with a hammer
 and nervous really sore i don't remember much else somebody had the same dress as me
 and that's that's all
 and 1 thing i remember from was either primary 1 or primary 2 because both of them were down at the same wee school was getting stung
 and i or kind of on the eye on eyelid by either beer wasp just a touch frightening
 yeah going to get cutted off down to the choose doctors which is quite close
 and ice pack
 and that's pretty much it
 but not what you want is this 6 or 7 year old also lose really tighter that was just
 so inevitable that kids because it was in the playground kids are just going to go running into each other as 2 kids go running from either side
 and it's a blind coin it kind of splodge straight into
 and they never did anything about it like put up a mirror
 so you could actually see if somebody coming
 yeah splunge i don't think i did i think it generally took more leisurely could see it happening way off that was pretty all i can remember from for 6 or 7 years of my life there must be things or objects the that that stick out the i don't know like a certain type of sweets that you had or toys i guess
 so now will i
 no i mean i think i'm aware of some some things that have be mentioned the stories
 but i have
 no true recollection of them in the same way that or it is very much a third party a third person memory that it's 1 that's like a christmas present i can remember or supposedly remember kind of the magic teapot or something i remember what 1 was like
 but i don't remember mine even though it's a standard thing it's kind of
 but i've heard all the stories about me getting it
 and all that
 but
 yeah i simply don't really remember something like that i don't know why do you remember caroline kenneth when you were in the car nightingales can have order maybe i was adopted
 so
 yeah all the memories start kind of from later on which is i don't know why most people have more memories from very early on
 but i don't know if they do i think a lot of it's invented
 yeah maybe it is more superimposed whereas i've had kind of i'll tend to think about these things
 and have realised that a lot of them are superimposed in silk
 and scrub them from my memory pretty much far more useful stuff to be learnt i can barely even remember when i was in frame with 3 when i was up at the big school as it was in a few memories like my last day at the school because i then went off to veg
 and memory handic smarties to everyone the smarty bar code
 and i also remember kind of finding school
 so easy the it can frustrate me quite a lot that we're still doing basic reading kind of beef chipping kipper with kind of 4 words per page
 and it was basically far too easy
 and i could i was already reading kind of
 and stuff
 so i do remember even then i didn't have to work to do
 well which i think set me off for bed
 yeah
 and i think i think they did set me up for going wrong on the basis that up until i was 16 i never had to work to be top of the class of thereabout
 so if you've never had to do it then you get out of the way of it or never got into it full stop
 so then when highest come along
 and you should do some work never quite got into it i can say it's
 but at the end of the day i think they're overrated that he's kind of 3 degrees what you want to do afterwards you into academia without the degrees
 yeah
 but indeed
 but this kind of the qualifications or means to an end
 but i think a lot of ends don't need the means that are deemed needed that for the job i'm doing someplace who's asking for a degree
 but why i kind of i don't think there is a need for a degree
 but it's just because
 so many people have a degree it then becomes the thing that's needed the stuff i do in my job i don't need anything learnt from about primary 5 onwards kind of basic adding multiplying subtracting dividing a bit of english able to communicate other than that it's just to prove you can learn
 but what does proving you can learn speak french prove to my ability to fix a computer there's
 but it's 1 of these things that society is deemed necessary
 and therefore nobody really goes against the grain to cover a wide range of things
 so you can see what you do like i i didn't i only found out in about senior 2
 and that was
 well mate to an extent primary 7 because we got got our first contact with computers then
 and it was a of kind of games just to get you into kind of the old pong
 and stuff like that
 and i was interested then i think largely because because kenneth
 and karen were both older than me
 and kenneth in particular who would be more likely to play games with me he was by that stage 17 or 18 i'm not really up for playing games with me as much kind of doing a 6 year studies as he was
 and when i was in primary 7 he was kind of working hard
 so it was basically i didn't have anyone to play with unless i was in school or actually went to the both of going out
 and seeing my mate
 so something like a computer game where you can play against some sort of intelligence was way better
 and i think that was kind of 1 of the things that got me into it
 and then next thing i'm more of the computers was probably second year when we used them in technology
 and i think i think we even have gone in break or something
 and it was just kind of hanging about with other people who were using them
 and i started using things like paint
 and just mucking about
 and then found then we got 1 ourselves
 and i found i could use it better than that other people which is see
 no real reason i didn't try hard it
 but it was just something that i followed computers logic
 and i think i think you either do or you i don't think it's something you really learn you can try hard
 but i think i'll naturally be better than anybody who isn't a natural regardless of how how hard to try
 and that's not particularly being arrogant i would say although it might come across as being arrogant
 but i think it it's just i do believe in kind of nature dictating over nurture there's still a combination of both
 but nature will always be strongest i won't ever be the world's strongest man there cause i'm a bit of a skinny git
 but you know i just kind of computers come naturally
 and whereas dad would try for ages to do something
 and be all proud of it kind of i'd do it in a couple of minutes
 and think much of it that we got it back to you very early's memory to do the michael jackson video do you think that do you think that prompted your interest subsequent interest in music or do think that that's sort of confirmed i think it confirmed because according to dad annoy that even when i was kind of still in court when he was playing music i would bounce about in time to the point that he's never seen anybody else move in the same way at that kind of age to to radio or to the piano or
 oh both
 yeah which i think again shows nature over nurture because there's
 no way that is a top response at that age because kenneth
 and karen both had the same kind of music going on
 and the background
 and didn't react in quite the same way
 oh
 yeah that they're both musical
 but i think music has played a far more important aspect in my life
 and it's i do get lost in music in a way that i don't think kenneth a cowan do i think i kind of like i'm not sure i think i think chem is kind of could do with the map when he's got listening to music
 but i'm truly kind of god knows who i am
 and to the point that somebody can walk past me who i know
 and i just won't realise
 and that has happened before
 and they've been saying hello to me
 and i've just walked straight past them just rather embarrassing when you see them the next day
 so i think it has
 and it was around before i saw it
 but that's what interested me in the video was it was something that was very intelligently done it's it's a great tune
 and it's pretty much faultless everything about it is
 so
 well produced
 and fits in together it is seamless at what point did you start to
 well
 and presumably you're not suggesting that at 2 you were able to discriminate
 and realise that that was what was at what point did you i start to flow preferences i suppose i think probably preferences even then that i'm assuming that i'd seen other music on the tv
 and hadn't reacted in the same way that had made such an impact
 and obviously kind of the classical stuff i was being played by record by was coming across
 and i was reacting positively to that
 but the other kind of the more pop side element of it i had reacted or i'm not aware of reacting to maybe i was
 but i'm not aware of it
 but then this came on
 and even as a teen i don't know why cause i don't think as a 2 year old i was able to determine a
 well produced film
 but there must there must be something almost subconscious about it
 and i'm worried about saying subconscious because i don't know how much of a subconscious a2 year old is i don't know
 but i don't how much of a conscious attitude has either
 so i think it's hard to work out what was going on in my mind tick tock is it's such like 1 off memory that
 yeah that i can look back
 and see that i was seeing the video i can't look back
 and see what i was thinking about the video in a way
 so i can't kind of analyse what was in my mind at the time i was just remembering why he is this music video that for some reason has me engrossed you know
 and
 so
 well michael jackson moving the first influence what what sort of i've obviously heard stories of the tapes that you all chose in the car how we kind of what kind of path did you have musical interest take from
 and for certainly good for years it was mainly classically based because kind of the stuff that was playing dad was the 1 who could afford music
 and had a system to play it on
 and i
 oh absolutely without doubt even now
 oh
 yeah
 no i'm still into classical music which to the surprise of a lot of people
 but i didn't buy my first album till about 9293 when i had been 11 or 12
 and that was the best rock album in the world
 and i think by that stage my influence was being was mainly led by kenneth because he was very much into the rock side where his dad
 and caroline
 and mum weren't
 so i think he definitely where i got a lot of the music of my teen years from that particular the heavy stuff because i was annoyed with life
 so kind it very much fits in
 and it is a difficult teenage music the kind of heavy metal
 and i think that's why these bands even going back to the sex pistols who work in a very aggressive
 and even before then the rolling stones et cetera who breaking new ground they by
 no means that loud or aggressive by today's standards
 but for the time they were they were kind of that generations voice
 and it's kind of changed slightly over the years it went to the sex pistols
 and kind of heavy metal
 and now wrapped to an extent
 so kind of these were were kind of heavy metals large influence because i was angry
 and it kind of fits in
 and when you're feeling * * * * * * * * * with the world
 and you've got other people who are feeling * * * * * * * * * with the world you feel there's other people there with you is it the lyrics music both you know kind of a lot of the lyrics i kind of pretty much were going to change the world
 and make it good
 and it's an interesting thing that you get particularly in 80s you
 and in america you had all these associations like mothers against metal or whatever who were strongly against heavy metal for its anti christian viewpoints
 and then you look at the lyrics of the songs
 and like anthax had 1 word which is basically saying don't care where you come from just get along
 and you're thinking hang on that's an utterly christian view
 and yet these christians are going out for blood against bands like these he he kind of has the christian view the christian or the 1 singing the metal i think it's a bastardised christian view that christian view should be love everyone
 but by going after them they're losing the christian view which i think it's a touch ironic really
 and i think they didn't endear themselves by going after them they just made them seem more the victim which more appeals to the rebellious teenager
 so they're going to go for them even more
 so i think that was singularly bad idea by the mothers against metal
 and all of the various associations
 and organisations i think the intention was vaguely honourable
 but they just didn't think that
 yes they want everything to be good
 but they don't think about what good is or public choice general freedom et cetera it's kind of moving towards a big brother society depends on your viewpoint on that
 but i'm certainly with our
 well on thinking it wasn't particularly good
 but
 so kind of i did have the metal influences
 but i didn't pick up all of kenneth's influences because he's also into his jazz which i've never picked up on
 but i think what i took from metal was the need for playing very technically difficult pieces which also had in common with classical music jazz is technical
 but i was felt with a lot of certainly the classical music i liked
 and the heavy metal that the music was going somewhere it's it's it's a hard phrase to understand cause
 well where's the music going
 but it's just something i feel jazz is kind of it's lots of notes fairly quick quite often
 but it doesn't really matter this it is it is mid
 but i've also seen too many live jazz musicians who kind of try
 and fuel or kind of lick
 oh we're
 so harshly done by
 and you know they're going back to their kind of nice house with all all that's good
 and i think that's something that's affecting metal that when metal started out the bands that were there had
 no money they were they were playing to survive
 so kind of the aggression claims against society held me out
 and i think that's why they've fallen down now that a lot of the bands who've got really big lose that edge because
 well
 yes i'm just off back to my 5 million penthouse kind of
 well why are you * * * * * * * * * with society really anymore you're doing quite
 well
 so i think that's kind of lost it
 and that's to an extent why 1 of the reasons why not been that keen on jazz because i feel it lacks emotion that blues is very different that it's less technically orientated
 but there's a lot of feeling in it mainly or kind of certainly in its origins it was deep south where kind of the black men only had the blues that was their life when they weren't slaves
 and they were very poor
 and they were playing for feeling
 and sometimes there's more like successful ones to make a living
 and if they didn't they didn't have anything else
 so kind of there was feeling in there
 but i just feel that jazz lacks feeling
 but going back to the kind of classical metal you kind of both of them are very technically orientated
 and certainly what i found when i went off to university was that a lot of the metal bands bowed heavily from classical music which i found very interesting that particularly kind of first artist that really got me into that was ingrid malmstein who you'd be listening to a song
 and then it would just go into bach or paganini
 and sound really good
 and i think that's kind of that aspect has definitely had a profound impact on my choice in music that i have now kind of separated away from what kenneth likes that my likes are pretty much classical things rocked up or rocky things that are very heavily classically inspired
 so kind of even over the past 6 months the lead female vocals which is very much more an operatic thing as opposed you get some pop bands that have female vocals
 but they've never really crossed over into metal as much
 but they do with the kind of classically inspired metal with violins
 and all kind of classical instruments going on in the background
 and i think that's it emerges my 2 main music interests together not with the popular thing
 but i like it
 and i know you're other
 well 1 of the big passion perhaps is the motorbike
 yeah does that fit into the do i kind of stereotypically probably fits into the heavy metal aspect perfectly
 but it's not related to that at all i kind of haven't been brighten up
 and still lament
 but it was kind of i used to cycle
 and then was kind of thinking
 oh i suppose i should really do with learning to be able to get myself over distances of more than 6 miles i don't i don't like criticism
 and i felt if i'm in a car i'm going to get criticised a lot
 so kind of being on a motorbike i'm by myself nobody's going to criticise me passengers
 and people in the
 yeah
 so kind of i would say most drivers are fairly * * * * * * y they're safe because they don't break the speed limit
 well some of them
 but that's a whole another story oddly like
 yes because you've the power to get out obviously if you crash there's there's a lot more that can go wrong in the basis that if you're doing 90
 and you come off it's going to be a whole lot worse than doing 20
 and coming off though i've got more safety equipment on when i'm on the motorbike
 but it's crashing hasn't really come into my mind it they're kind of mum always kind of worries
 but i'm much more what will be will be if i'm going to crash i'm going to crash it can have life full of turns
 and it's only normal that she should worry about you than you
 yeah she's not in control of it you are
 yeah
 yeah
 but i think kind of by the nature or certainly going by other people likelihood is in my life of riding motorbikes i will have a crash simply
 well everyone i know who's had a motorbike other than 1 who's only got 1 a week ago has crashed the bike
 so logic would take that in our likelihood will at some point come off my bike which is a bit of a pants weighing situation
 but i kind of i don't spend any time worrying about it it's not kind of it doesn't play on my mind at all
