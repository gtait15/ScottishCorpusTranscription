So You back Mm Can you think about what your earliest memory is Yes yes my earliest 
memory would be I was born in 1944 so my earliest memory would probably be about 1947 
or 8 when I was 4 year old and I had gone to the ponds to get 
some fish And I had a jam jar with some string round it and I had a 
fishing net and I had about 15 Little minnows in the water and I was really really 
happy So I brought it back and I was climbing up the stairs to go into the 
house to show off my catch and the a girl who lived above me who sadly was 
Down syndrome And and was a wee bit aggressive Came up the stairs grabbed the jar swung 
it as hard as she could It against the wall And all the fish were in a 
big puddle on the steps squirming about and the just the noise of the glass crashing And 
then all these little minnows squirming in the pond was just too much for me And I 
evidently rang Off You know yelling my head off and I do know what happened to her 
Then You know she could do the help but she was She was She was right Sheila 
name was And that that one of my earliest memories Of And we lived That was in 
Craigie in the tenement A room in the kitchen Five of us in that House mother was 
6 but then my dad died Five of us in that house my mom two brothers and 
a sister and myself And I was the youngest And the toilet was on the stair There 
was no electricity until just before we left that we had gas Lamps And we left Craigie 
in when I was 7 so that would be 1951 We left Cleggie in just It was 
just before that that they got electric lighting in these houses The outside was lit by gas 
lamp Know the outside lights In the street and on the stairs the man the Lamplighter came 
at night and put the lights on and came in the morning and put them off There 
was a natural lump later And he came with a great big long pole that he would 
cause the gas lamps were really high up to keep them away from the kids So he 
came up with a great big long pole and I do know how he did it but 
he just seemed to stick the pole into the glass And the light either went on or 
went off I never get discovered what that poem was all about but that was what he 
did so it was It was a A colorful place to live in many ways And I 
have How old were you when your dad died I was just coming up for two when 
my dad died He had some some injuries in the war and when he came home from 
the war he was most unwell and he developed tuberculosis And there was no cure for tuberculosis 
in these days So he was put into hospital And when it became clear that he was 
going to die my mum took him out of the We were all sent out of the 
House because it was so contagious tuberculosis so we were put away from the House you know 
ferried out to different people to look after us And my mum looked after him And then 
he died And the five of us stayed on in the house until as I say 19 
51 and then we were sent out to me was the country and was a bungalow And 
the Council had started to decant people from the centre of the city Out to the housing 
schemes which virtually were built in the country and certainly for us townies we were surrounded by 
fields in the housing estate that we were sent to So no that was infinitely Infinitely And 
there was 3 bedrooms There was a bath which was a huge luxury There was a bath 
And the toilet And of course the biggest luxury was that it was indoors You know we 
did have to go out to the toilet And we had a proper kitchen and a living 
room and a front and back door and a garden And that was incredible for for And 
I only had a short experience of my life in a tenement But for people who were 
born and bred and brought up in tenements all their lives to move out to a council 
house in the country With all these facilities was just amazing But one of the problems with 
that was the Council were not very long sighted because they put people out there There was 
no infrastructure built The roads were completed so there was no transport could come out there There 
was no shops so it meant that people had to walk into town Now it was that 
far It was that far but It did mean hike into town for shopping Then the started 
through time to have some Vans come You know a Baker van would come out and a 
butcher van and a fish van But of course they were expensive because they you know they 
had their overheads for their vehicles So most people trekked into the town and then gradually gradually 
shops were built as the schemes developed and got Because we were in the 1st that was 
ever built in Finchley It called Finch Gardens and that was the 1st of this Is now 
a huge Housing estate But when the say when the first steep was built there was there 
was no there was no I mean there was actually no Road was The houses were built 
and they were complete but there was no Rd you know so it was a kind of 
a muddy track up to the house Sounds incredible because it all laid out now and everything 
you know everything you know all the roads are complete and there a huge Neither schools and 
shops and You know clinics and all this kind of thing there now but there was in 
these days But anyway nevertheless I thought I died and gone to heaven because it was just 
incredible In fact I kept Evidently I do remember this but evidently I kept running through the 
house It was such a novelty to go in one door run through the house and out 
the other door It was a huge huge novelty And then like every other novelty it just 
became you know it just wore off and it was just your house And that was fine 
But Were you at school Yeah well there another story with that My my mum I had 
gone to the school Gloucester Craigie And so when I moved out to the housing scheme my 
mother I think the next day my mother took me to the window and pointed to the 
wee school that was in the Field a few fields away there was a wee school in 
the field and she said to me see that That building there and I see Josh is 
that the school you going to tomorrow And of course I My usual you know I do 
want to go to that school because You know I got all my friends are at Cleveland 
Do want to go there Oh well you have no choice That where you going And the 
next day she took me down to the corner of the street and two girls One was 
called Ruth Gold and one was called Dorothy Wright and I remember them so clearly and she 
said to them You going down to that school and they said yes and said well take 
her with you That true Now there would be maybe a year older than You know they 
bigger than me but they took me to the school and they took me into the headmaster 
and said this is the New Girl Starting here today so he said Know what your Gave 
him a name and he said go along to Room 4 And I just had to walk 
along the corridor and go into room 4 and the teacher there said just come in She 
looked at the register Was obviously expecting me Looked at the register and said just sit down 
there And my worry was that on Blackboard they were doing joined up writing Joint operator and 
she said to the Now I want you to copy this passage into your daughter and you 
handed me a split new daughter and a split new pencil And and I said I sorry 
but I do do that kind of writing And she said well you do now That the 
kind of writing we do here So having gone from just you know I do know what 
you call the not joint the unjoined writing To the joint operating Shifted from that in a 
matter of a morning and And then came home and was showing off that I could now 
write in In Big peoples rating you know big people that is the way big people wrote 
So that was my That was my job and I was very pleased with I was worried 
to begin with but yeah I was very pleased with that and I loved that school Actually 
loved that It called Lin Lathan primary And one of my teachers I was a lady called 
Eleanor Leith that we of course called Miss Leath and but she told us her name was 
Eleanor and she I was a bit of a mischief but she seemed to like me and 
One day I had a sore tooth and because we did have a dentist or anything God 
I do think I had a toothbrush in these days Made a dentist but anyway she said 
What wrong with you I maybe been mumping and sulking because I was in pain with this 
tooth And had told her I had a sore tooth and she says well get your mummy 
to take you to the dentist And and I saw well my my mum does have time 
to do that you see because you know I mean we do know where the dentist is 
and all this nonsense She Well I tell you what she said I take you to a 
dentist and At I got to sit in her That was a huge excitement I got to 
sit in her car and she took me to this dentist down in Stobswell We went in 
went up the stairs was up a stair Up the It was a bit scary because I 
never been in a dentist and all the instruments were there and everything But the great thing 
was on his on the radio which was in his the surgery bit He had Scottish music 
playing and all the time the music was playing he was singing along to it you know 
I mean it was amazing And he sat me in the chair and gave me a swirl 
around Let it swirl around a wee He knew I was frightened And Miss Leith just popped 
her head in and then popped her head out again And he did whatever he did to 
the tooth I do know whether he I do even know whether he pulled it out or 
whether he filled it that I ca remember But he looked after the tooth anyway and he 
gave me a little Round 10 of toothpaste And a tiny little brush he just gave it 
to me to take home And he said because he said you brush your teeth And I 
said no I did have a toothbrush or toothpaste so he gave me the toothpaste and the 
toothbrush And he said now when you go home you need to brush Teeth in the morning 
before we go to school and at night before you go to bed And he said you 
have very good teeth but you want to keep them Keep them good You eat many sweeties 
And I said no because we did We did get sweeties But for some reason one of 
my tooth had gone a bit but my teeth had gone a bit So that was that 
And it was the next day at school and Miss Leath ran me back to where I 
was I lived by that Now we were in a prefab and so she ran me back 
to my to the house or or to the street where I lived anyway and I jumped 
out the car and she said to me did you notice the name on the dent Ist 
did you notice the name on the plaque outside And I said no and I noticed the 
black Never mind the name And she said well the name says Gordon S Leith Dental surgeon 
and Gordon Leith is my father and I says ah your father a dentist And she said 
yes So now I went to that dentist for years after that you know went every six 
months or whatever it was you know for your checkups and And kept up you know with 
the dentist for many many years after that Until I went to You know that you that 
you went to Buses Sticking it in Leith died because he was a He was a good 
age when you know he was quite elderly When I went with that night with Miss Leath 
so he was a good agent He died and then I did have a dentist for a 
wee while And then I started going to And then he was the life long dentist after 
that Looked after you folks teeth as well But yeah I loved that school Was a great 
school It like yeah yeah She was a really really nice person Mislead And she was really 
she used to give us all a Christmas present Everybody got the whole class Got a Christmas 
present Now it was just a small thing you know maybe a penny dainty or something like 
that But the great thing was that you got called out Your desk You got you got 
caught out of your seat to come and get it And you felt so important you know 
and she always Me to last I was always the last because I I was alphabetically I 
was last with nobody behind me Alphabetically because I was tea for Tate and and I was 
always last and the anticipation because it was always in a little brown a little brown paper 
bag So you did know what what you were going to get and everybody got something everybody 
different And oh anticipation of that And then you would go out and you see something like 
Well I hope you have a very nice Christmas and we take care on the roads and 
I will see you after the after the holiday Know she always said that every year we 
had her for years I think So she she sticks in my memories as far as teachers 
are concerned because she was so kind and she was really kind as well to all the 
naughty ones You know how you know including myself You had these naughty people And she she 
was the one as well Um When she said I was misbehaving one day and she said 
to me Get hsi ca Did know she here Outside No She said Out and I did 
mean I did know whether she meant out the class or out the school Out of Dundee 
or out of everything So I thought well if you stand outside the door and the headmaster 
comes along you get into trouble because he knows you been put out for being naughty So 
I thought well the only thing to do is go home And I went right out of 
school And the thing was I knew that that if I got home once I got home 
there would be nobody in that I would be stuck because my mum was working all of 
us at school My brother was home on leave from Army But I was very sure about 
that Whether he would be home It was a winter day a dark day and when I 
came up to near the prefab I could see the light on in the bathroom So I 
knew I knew he was in so I went in And he said to me why you 
home You should be at school And I first of all said I was And I was 
feeling I was feeling sick so that first of all I thought try that tack To me 
this is Neil and he said to me you do look sick And I saw Do he 
got really sore tummy And eventually it came out that I been put out because I was 
wanting to ask him whether she meant I forever or just out so he Well if you 
been naughty I think you probably been told to get Out of the classroom not out of 
the whole school school And certainly not out of education the education system So you say no 
you do know what you have to And I said no he says Well you have to 
go right back after lunchtime and you have to stand at our desk and the school bell 
rings Line up Then you go to her You get into school get into the classroom go 
to our desk and say Miss Leith I really sorry for misbehaving this morning And I wo 
do it again And then I said well no See I ca do that because everybody laugh 
And he says well that why you have to do it That why you got to say 
you really sorry and you wo do it again And I was going back down the road 
saying I not doing that I not doing that I just going to sit in the classroom 
and I not saying anything I just going to go in go to my desk and sit 
down And I went into the classroom and I do know why I did this I do 
know why I did it to this day but I sort of sidled up to the desk 
and she was trying not to look at me Could see me at the corner of her 
eye Was trying not to look at me Eventually she turned round and she said Yes And 
I said what Neil said for me to say with great difficulty but but I said it 
And she just said one word Sit So I just turned from the desk and But then 
I was happy because I thought I back in again You know I was quite sure how 
things were going to go if I was Out forever You How was it going to learn 
things Or or when could I play in the playground if I was The You know so 
I was happy to be back in that school system again Quite known for that kind of 
So were you because there was the time at nursery as well that you just sort of 
might be able to Uh huh Uh Well I was actually able from school because you see 
I was brought up in the nursery and I was in the nursery when I was months 
old because my mom had to go to work and there was all these council nurseries where 
babies were taken in Because it was just after the war and you know things were very 
very different And anyway I was brought up in Ellen gown nursery Every day I went there 
and I was virtually just taken home at night and put to bed So the nursery was 
my home The nursery was my was really like my home And when I went to school 
I Went to school the first day When you know was taken in registered and everything And 
at play time when we came out to play I just walked out the school and walked 
back to the nursery Which was within walking distance of the school I just went right back 
to the nursery because I thought well it time to go home now And then I evidently 
appeared at a window that very low windows in this nursery school The windows were deliberately low 
You know the windows actually came down quite So that the nurses could see out if the 
children were playing out But I had looked in the window Of the matron of the the 
nursery school and she was sitting at her desk writing and she looked up and she said 
evidently she said to my mum all she could see was this Hid a blonde curls looking 
in the window and thinking oh God she back She Oh God we got her back So 
she beckoned to me to come in Now I went into her She said to me what 
are you doing here And I said well I just came back because I been to school 
now and it was okay but that it And she said no no You do come back 
here Oggy You have to stay at school You at school You do come to nursery school 
and she phoned the school And said you have to send her sister along for an olive 
was in a few primaries above me You have to send her sister for So Olive came 
for me dragging me on the road because she was fed up She been taken out of 
a class that she was really enjoying Art or And she had to come and collect me 
So she took me back Now after that I think I was the start of the locking 
gates and things in schools because then the lock the gate I just walked out of the 
gate And I never actually did go back to the nursery school but I was really sad 
you know because it it really was my my life the nursery It was my home for 
for all these years and the nurses were like mums really You know the nurses We all 
because you were taken there like my mum started in the mills at She would probably start 
at half seven So I be taking it at the back of seven just after And then 
I would be picked up until half five quarter to At night And then of course you 
know my mum would be tired so it would be taken home and bathed or or maybe 
not even bath just taken home and put to bed Really So that why it was important 
that the nursery That why the nursery school was so important to me What was here Doing 
machine also working the mins Yeah yeah You see there was no detail Look after you because 
everybody you know my mum sisters and brothers What all in the mill and the older the 
older a different job and my my mum was a spool Winder Which just is exactly what 
it says You wound the flax onto the And there was a that when my mother asked 
was a Weaver and there was a finisher and there was a flattener and there was a 
sparker and oh there was all the different trades of of The Jew industry and all worked 
in different parts of it You know my mum said at one stage There was a member 
of the family in every every sector of the mill Right at the beginning and then because 
the flax goes through different processes you know it arrives off the ships from packet or arrived 
off the ships from Pakistan And then it went through various processes and my mum reckoned at 
one stage You know the family had all grown up and at one stage there was one 
of them in each in each area of the mill Um Siblings did Well she was the 
oldest of 13 Chad Chad Chad 12 brothers and sisters I thought there was 6 girls and 
seven boys 6 girls and Seven boys twins Joseph and James they died in They were about 
four months old evidently when they died but that was common long ago sadly because that was 
before inoculations And that when things where people With that size of a family Certainly could afford 
to nourish them all Know they would They would be all well nourished I would And they 
lived a very hard life In a very very small house in the centre of the town 
near the docks And my mum being the oldest had all the work had a lot of 
work to do you know besides her besides her job she had a lot of work to 
do in the house with the children And it does sound like a great life at all 
It was a good life At your mum dad was he My mum dad Yeah he was 
called Joseph and he was He was a bit of a a dead horse through the years 
My mum would put it because he drank very heavily and he worked He worked on the 
docks he worked Was a what they call a plater and that was a skill that that 
Was to do with ship building Plating was to do with you know putting the outside pieces 
on the on the actual ship And so that when my grandfather did But very often he 
was never at his work because he could lift his head off the pillow if he was 
really drunk But Magrani used to be able to go down and get his wages Yeah she 
would go to the docks And they knew what my grandfather was like and they knew that 
she had this huge family and she used to get Just picked up his wages He did 
touch his wages And but said he always got money somewhere for She never never yet really 
knew where he got it from but he always managed to get money for drink So she 
had a very hard life extremely hard life And yet she was very tough Very resilient means 
she was in her 80s and she was still helping you know washing nappies for her various 
you know grandchildren and whatever else So she was really a bit of a character that Yes 
yes She could get round your name Kenneth She could She mean Kerris that She never heard 
of it of course but then it sounded really like a boy so she could could cope 
with that at all But yeah I think I had a really really hard time And when 
my mum Was expecting This just gives you an idea The culture at the time When my 
mum was expecting me mum her mum was My Gran had gone to the pictures had gone 
to see a film and they were sitting in the pictures and my mum you know the 
her due date was a few weeks away so but she started to feel Uncomfortable in the 
pictures and she said to my grana Not really not feeling too good so my Well she 
listened to her saying that if we found eventually she all come on We walk up the 
road So they started to walk up the road and walking up the road was becoming more 
and more uncomfortable for my mum It was that far but it was up a hill and 
she was and she really was uncomfortable anyway They got up to The circle round about where 
my granny lived because we were going back to my And her my mum brothers several of 
my mum brothers were hanging about on the corner as they did in these days So my 
granny says you better go down for the midwife and my mumma definitely said I do think 
I needing a midwife I think I still got a bit to go yet but I really 
uncomfortable My granny said To Thomas go and get the midwife Thomas took T seals And ran 
down through Mccrady to find the midwife by which time now we had got where my mum 
and my Gran had got home and my Gran said to my mumma You better go through 
and lie down because she had been looking a bit white And poorly So she went through 
to lie down And I came into the world and my Gran said the midwife arrived and 
my granddaughter said too late Know she the baby born so My grand virtually brought me into 
So that was you know that was that Quite a few people you know a few of 
the neighbors that had gone into to labour too quick you know the midwives did get there 
in time My Gran thought nothing of it That means you had 13 of her own She 
knew then she knew Delivered some of She knew fine what to do and so on So 
I mean it was quite nice because she used to tell me years later That you know 
she had brought me into the world and fortunately it was quite an easy birth You know 
there was no complication I sure if there complications then you have to get into hospital But 
most babies in these days were born at home and you only went to hospital to have 
your baby In these days if there was a complication Most infants were born at home so 
my granny Certainly brought me into the world And was it common in Was it coming for 
men to be round No Oh no Oh no It was common for men to be around 
when you were born kennis some men did it Some men chose to do it but it 
was common And I think a lot of it Do even think it was so much the 
men did want to be there The hosp Did want them there It They changed you see 
That all changed now With hospital and I think it changed for the better The hospital recognizes 
that mums Want the dad there Want their husbands there in some cases but in in certainly 
in my mums My God my my my dad Well certainly my dad was at You know 
he was in the Navy and he was away with the war But I would have doubted 
if he would have been there and none of the boys were allowed in the room You 
know none of the brothers or or certainly my brothers were allowed into the room Yeah it 
was very very different in these days But I think I think my mum by the time 
I came along had probably just had enough babies you know should have brought practically brought up 
all her own siblings and then she had of her own I think she just well had 
enough by that time And That right That right So I mean it was It was hard 
for her there no doubt about it But yeah it just seems it seemed that long ago 
but and yet in some ways it a million light years from from nowadays Know how things 
have changed and and some things have definitely changed for the better but I still think some 
things were were better in our day in that you know we could we could play in 
the street There no I mean cars never came along our street Cars I was Was It 
was in a car until I was about because and the only reason I was in a 
car was because I was a float guy At our next door Neighbour wedding and Olive and 
I got to sit in a in a car and we thought that was amazing and I 
I got gloves That was another amazing thing I got I mean I did worry I was 
like you and you were little cares Never liked dresses and things Neither did I and the 
only way I would wear the dress was I had gloves I got to wear these gloves 
and I remember my mum saying I mean it ridiculous You know She does like wearing a 
dress but she happy to wear the gloves So for some reason we had these little white 
you know wrist gloves and I thought it was I was really something in these gloves and 
Yeah So you think do you think it much safer then for children or do you think 
it just that we hear more about what goes on I think it was generally safer and 
yet I was to hear away from the street but we would go into But I think 
it was generally safer and the reason for that is that an awful lot of the neighbors 
hung around the street There was more there was more community Spirit I think then And that 
might be just because even if the layout of the houses I do know but there seemed 
to in our street there was a 2 shops on the end of the street You know 
there was Grocer and a grocer like a fruit shop and a So and the the the 
ladies of the street certainly the elderly ladies of the street used to sit on the short 
window sills and you know share their snuff boxes and chatter away of an evening Know they 
were all there was always somebody in the street So of course when kids were playing you 
know the fell over or they were unwell or they were fighting something these elderly ladies were 
unwittingly Babysitters you know because they say hey stop that or you know they They would get 
involved in some fracas if if anything was happening and I think that culture has gone I 
think that cultures gone because people are Well I think I think it might have just been 
the layout of the buildings and everything Not sure And the fact that it was there was 
no traffic came along the street and there was no buses you see in these days it 
was tram cars and the tram cars Down the Main Street because of the cable line So 
the street really was A playground The street was the playground And we had We had Baxter 
Park but then you could walk to Baxter Park unless somebody took you there You know because 
it was a fairly step for us But the boys you know my brothers they they played 
in the street they played football on the street and there was air rage There was air 
raid shelters around the back In our clothes you know foot for the war And of course 
they were taken down Even after the war finished So the best thing in the world was 
to climb on the top of them And there would be maybe 910 feet You know they 
were that high but high when you wee Of course you were allowed on them There was 
a big rule and kids were allowed on the Like to go in them but they were 
allowed to go on the top of them and they were all manner of ways of wooden 
ladders and things and We we sort of piles of stones that that would be erected to 
get you up onto the They were all hidden around from the from the windows hidden around 
the back so that your mum if she looked out she could see climbing onto the shed 
You never climbed on a shelter of course That was within sight of your own window Everybody 
went to another shell And there was one day that Oliver Knee where you know they got 
me up onto the shabs About 3 seemingly And they got me up onto this shelter And 
I mean we were just We just felt we were so mischievous and being so dared devilish 
you know on the top of the shelter And I can remember actually being a bit wimpy 
and thinking you know seemed so high once And then the next thing was the policeman came 
through the Big Bend And all because he was the top of his helmet And all of 
his estimate lie flat on your face and do say a word So I spread eagle down 
the top of this shelter and little did we know that this guy could just stand on 
the pile of stones that we got up on and then we could see his whole head 
looking across And all he did was great big man and He did was put over these 
massive hand pluck me off of And you know lift me down but drop me about a 
foot from the bombs so that it did get down with too much ease and any Licked 
his pencil Shift through his notebook to get to the right page And then he said Name 
So of course your name meant in the policeman book and the idea now was the policeman 
Going to To your door and tell your mum you been on the shelters So all of 
a sudden I decided we were actually going to have to run away We could not go 
home because the punishment would fit the crime and the crime was bad and the punishment would 
be worse So we thought well we just make a run for it So we went out 
the close and we got along to the end of the street and olive just kept saying 
to me just keep following me Just keep following me And then we looked up the street 
and all of a sudden see was my Gran coming down Albert bustling a shoulder She always 
came down so she was on a mission She came down and she shouted So of course 
she seemed to do this you see So Olive goes up Are you doing What are you 
doing on the end of the street One is supposed to be on the end of the 
You supposed to be in the middle of the street so Olive said We just we just 
looking for somebody She well get and that meant Get meant get home So we just did 
tail and went back and we were sort of sat outside for a while thinking well has 
he been yet Has he been to the door yet Or or will he go after Because 
we thought well We need to We need to get some tea sometime so we unsure whether 
We should go And have the tea and then get the belting Or I would just not 
go but I not I mean I got this story in my head and I not just 
sure what happened but certainly we never got into trouble So I do think the guy ever 
went near the door Do think the policeman did but on saying that we never went on 
the shelters again Because we just got such afraid that if my mum I give a policeman 
went to your door I mean that was the end of the world you know Can you 
remember Russian name Hydration books right up until we did have rashing books in Fintry so we 
imagine I think 1948 Or 4849 would be the end of the rationing I think And that 
why I would never any sweeties Because you did get coupons for sweeties but you could swap 
them for coupons for an egg This kind of thing Of course my main sweeties were Were 
for rich children you know So we never ever got sweeties I can remember getting an Easter 
egg When I was quite big when I say that maybe 8 or 9 from Uncle John 
but Oliver 9 Easter egg and ah I mean you just thought all your birthdays come together 
An Easter egg to yourself and morning Woolworths And the woman went to put mine in a 
bag you know put it in a bag And I did want In a bag because I 
had to show off I wanted everybody in the world to see this Easter egg I really 
show off that it was mine and of course my mum confiscated the Easter egg as soon 
as we got home The Easter egg was put into the cupboard and we were only allowed 
a tiny little bit every day and she was allowed a tiny little bit of our Easter 
egg every day So with the result that Easter egg lasted seemed to last forever But we 
just we just any mean you could steal it Know you could mean that did occur to 
us without We could go and steal a bit more but she knew she knew Was data 
Easter eggs so you could not steal it and And I reckon I got a theory on 
this because I reckon that why we all had good teeth You know we never had a 
blind toothbrush But then we never had sweeties And we did have biscuits You know you did 
have a lot of sweet things Did have really a lot of anything but you certainly did 
have a lot of sweet things But you have got a love got a lot of happy 
memories I do have memories sadly of like ever getting on my mum knee or getting a 
story or not have any story books or I loved I loved going to the the little 
Storey Storey In the library there a little storytelling classes where you could primaries and three got 
allowed to go to the library and a lady would come and Read a story to you 
and That was great I loved that because this lady would make all the characters come to 
life and she would speak like the character did now So that was really clever Because because 
she became that character in the book you know But after you came out of primary three 
that was it Know you never got another story in your life That was the end of 
stories so I do have memories of that kind of home life but I have Have happy 
memories Of situations and incidents at school and outside of home life you know I love that 
When did you start going skating That the thing that like Yeah skating I started to go 
when I was probably in secondary school Yeah started going when I was Started to try and 
learn to skate and that was a laugh because you know you spent more time on the 
on the ice than you did on your feet but But eventually you know after years of 
years of playing on became quite a good skater certainly quite a good speed skater Peter used 
to like to go up at the what they call the lady speed and you know the 
ladies would go and go around as fast as they could And then there was the men 
speed Then there was the dancing and I did Was good enough for that but Yeah They 
danced on ice Yeah Maureen golden I remember Maureen Golden the first time I ever saw her 
ever saw her was on the ice and it was only after he met up with her 
Years later I said to her I recognise you You used to be a nice A dance 
iced dance skate did And she said yes she had the most beautiful I remember she always 
had different costumes on and she was very very good Chief Secretary Ice Dan skater and I 
still have watching it at that Most people just went away and had a cup of tea 
or a drink of juice when the But on but I always did Was just like to 
The A few couples would go and do the dancing together It really it really was good 
But yeah we like skating The skating well I got I thought I was really really something 
I got a pair of wine burgundy corduroy trousers And a white polo neck jumper And that 
was a really trendy in these days Really trendy And then I ca remember I had a 
skating skirt I had a skating skirt because girls wore skating skirts in these days And I 
can remember just not liking it because I thought it was too long and I said to 
olive you know sister Could you Could you could you shorten that for me You know ca 
do anything for herself Said could you Shorten that for me And so she starts to pin 
up a bit you see And I want it shorter than that It shorter than that And 
she was seeing You could get it any shorter than now for goodness sake and I think 
it was Neil Neil And you know came in and all this nonsense and me saying I 
did know And and he said no you do He said it that a good length away 
That is just now He said Always remember it what people do see It more interesting not 
what they see and I never forgotten that So anyway I got my skirt that the the 
decent length and that was that but we did wear skirts too long and then or or 
too you know It was mostly It was mostly trousers because it was cold you know and 
if you went down Were the skating skirt on Know you were You soaking you know in 
a Your trousers give you a wee bit more protection and it was great fun I loved 
Guess where I met my first boyfriend Bill Bill Heron I swear I met him but he 
really fancied my friend He fancied my friend Carol Raines So it was really after things things 
just went sideways in Cairo I had to wait in line and then after things went really 
sad with him and Carol He started to skate around with me That was what you You 
the meant the boys came and sort of skated alongside you When I think back and he 
offered me a piece of his chewing gum that was quite serious That was it I thought 
he was probably the next question would be would be wanting to marry me That was the 
next question The next question was how far do you live from the ice rink That was 
before he said I walk you home So you had to wait and see how far it 
was and was in his direction now And fortunately it was kind of Indiana his direction and 
saw Beline Sort of skated around together went for wee walks You know maybe about at this 
time went for wee walks on a Sunday around Cape Park and scintillating stuff And I I 
like I liked he had a lovely little sister I remember There was There was Bill and 
then there was this huge gap you know and then his mum had this unexpected little baby 
you know a little girl And she I I remember And I just thought she was gorgeous 
Like it was Shirley Temple Only blonde And sometimes he used to come with her and we 
would take her to the park and and stuff like that And then we just sort of 
drifted You know it was drifted away but certainly the skating that the first boyfriend was Was 
on the cards Yeah skating was really good fun And again it was dead safe because we 
used to come out the skating and walk all the way home you know along the Kingsway 
all the way home Was a long way that was quite a long way but there was 
never any trouble or anybody being In Attacked or assaulted or mugged or anything like that Know 
it was It seemed to be dead safe Yeah it was good You liked skating too did 
you Yeah yeah yeah
