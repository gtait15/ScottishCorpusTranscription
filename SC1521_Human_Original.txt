she came over they came over from Ireland.
F718: So they came over to Scotland from Ireland?

F1077: as far as I know, my my dad's parents are both well and truly
English, but my mum's mum was from Ireland. I can't remember her name.
F718: And you've still got relatives around the //Dundee area?//

M1078: //Mmhm.// well my father had Dundee con- strong Dundee connections
F718: //Mm.//
F1077: //Mmhm.//
F718: //[sniff]//
M1078: //in the family.//
F718: Did he have any particular words that he used that weren't, that that
were, that sort of pinned him down as Dundee rather than West Coast?
//Anything that you remember that was//
M1078: //[inhale]// //Not that I remember because erm//
F718: //different?//
M1078: I I I don't really know Dundee words to //say that's a Dundee one,
they're just words.//
F1077: //Well they they use 'ken' a lot; did he do that?// //Ken. "Do you
ken something?"//
F718: //Mmhm.//
M1078: //[cough], Mm? Ken? Oh no, that's up north. That's er Peterheid.//
//You ken?//
F1077: //Cause my Auntie Mina and// the rest of the family use that
although my mother didn't cause she'd been in England a long time, but my
Auntie Mina and them used to say "ken". //Mmhm.//
M1078: //Mmhm.//
F1077: But o- one thing when we were talking about this, that appleringie
thing recently, which is a word I hadn't heard since childhood, //my mother
called it appleringie.//
F718: //Yeah, c- uh-huh.// //Uh-huh.//
F1077: //But// Dad's dad
M1078: My father.
F1077: called it, what was it?
M1078: Flechinel.
F1077: Flechinel. And yet he was from the Dundee area //as well.//
F718: //Mmhm, mm.//
M1078: //No, well he wasn't. The family// //had connections there, but it
was really Clydebank he lived in all his//
F1077: //Oh right, the background then. Mmhm, mmhm, mmhm.// //Mmhm.//
F718: //Right.//
M1078: //life till they got married.//
F718: To fill in the backstory of this, cause obviously I I know what
//you're talking about, but er the rest of the world might not,//
F1077: //Mm, mm uh-huh.// //Right uh-huh, it's er//
F718: //appleringie is what?// //Mmhm.//
F1077: //Southernwood or artemesia.//
M1078: //Southernwood.//
F1077: And er the only time I'd ever heard it called appleringie was as a
child. It was in the garden and it was always appleringie. //I always had
this//
F718: //It's very scented, isn't it, a-// //southernwood, yeah.//
F1077: //aye, very sort of herbally smell, and I always used to have
this//
M1078: //Yes, mmhm.//
F1077: picture of kind of rings of apple with the //the cores//
F718: //Mm.//
F1077: core missing it always brought up, the there were always //sort of
dried rings of apple; it was always what I thought about.//
F718: //Mmhm.// Mm.
F1077: //Erm,//
M1078: //[cough]// //[cough]//
F1077: //as I say er southernwood, and then this flechinel. I think we
looked up 'flechie', I can't remember what it meant but we looked up
'flechie',// //cause you weren't sure how it was spelt.//
F718: //Mmhm.//
M1078: //Mmhm, don't know uh-huh.//
F1077: Aye, I would spell it F.L.E.C.H.I.E.
F718: //Does the 'flechie' part of the word mean anything in particular?//
M1078: //Same as me.//
F1077: Yeah, but I can't remember, we'd have to look at the dictionary.
//Yeah, uh-huh.//
F718: //Right, oh we'll maybe just leave it just now. [laugh]// //Right.//
F1077: //Aye we wo-, we worked out, [?]counted[/?], how it came to be
called that.// But er the only other kind of Scottish word I can remember
that sticks in my mind when I was young was the word 'sleekit', because I
didn't even know it was Scottish, //until I//
F718: //Right.//
F1077: used it in a, it was an essay, and it was, I was writing about a
character in something like "Barchester Towers", who was called, I think it
was Mr Slope, he had the name that suggested his character.
F718: Uh-huh.
F1077: And I used the word 'sleekit' and I got the essay back and there was
a query beside it,
F718: Mmhm. //[laugh]//
F1077: //and luckily the the English teacher was Scottish, he was from
Glenrothes, so he knew what it meant.// //But I didn't//
F718: //But it's quite, is it not quite common or// //quite well-known as a
Scottish word? Exactly yeah. Sleekit.//
F1077: //Well apparently not, no, he said, mm. Right, well how many//
M1078: //Well it's a Burns, it's used in Burns, "wee sleekit cowerin
timrous beastie".//
F1077: people in England would know much about Burns?
F718: //But if they knew anything, that would be the line they'd know.//
M1078: //Oh, mmhm.//
F1077: Hm. //Well,//
F718: //Probably.// //Mm, mmhm, mmhm.//
F1077: //it seemed, apparently it was a a word I shouldn't be using in an
English essay cause it was just a Scottish word.// //So it stuck in my
mind.//
F718: //Mmhm.// So when you moved up to Scotland, what, did you notice any,
or, [laugh] did it come as a shock? [laugh] //Did you//
F1077: //[laugh]// //The first thing that happened, got off the train at
Queen Street.//
F718: //were there words you didn't understand?//
F1077: [laugh] //It would be January nineteen sixty-nine, er oh, no, it was
February.//
F718: //How come Queen Street,// //coming up from the South?//
M1078: //Train.// //No, East Coast.//
F1077: //That's where we got off. Oh yeah, from, uh-huh,// //through, up to
Edinburgh and then across, mmhm.//
F718: //Right, right.//
M1078: //Edinburgh to//
F1077: And er it was Rag Week.
F718: [sniff] //[laugh]//
F1077: //And there were all these strange [laugh] people on the station. We
wondered what we'd come to, cause// //they were all dressed up and
everything.//
M1078: //[inaudible] Rag Week.//
F1077: That's why I think, I thought it was January, but maybe it was
February. //Erm, mm all these weird people.//
M1078: //No I think it was Jan-//
F1077: And then before we came, once we'd applied for jobs and got jobs, I
remember there was a story in the the paper about erm a body found in a bin
in Glasgow,
F718: [laugh] //[laugh]//
F1077: //[cough], which kind of made us think twice about it, but we came
anyway.//
F718: Yeah, [sniff].
F1077: [swallows coffee] And then we met in nineteen seventy-one. At?

//It has several//
M1078: //Mmhm.// //Uh-huh, mmhm mmhm.//
F718: //Is it still there, or is there still a club in the same building?
Mmhm.//
F1077: //It is, there is still a club there, I'm sure. It was on the the
first floor of a building, [inaudible] entrance.// Erm mmhm. And we met
there because we were both in the Young Conservatives; it was a Young
Conservatives disco.
F718: [laugh] Er isn't there a story that you you were there with a
//friend and the friend said "You have the lanky one cause I want the other
one". [laugh]//
F1077: //Yeah.//
M1078: //Mmhm, mmhm.//
F718: //Or is that just the version you told me?//
F1077: //I don't think it was lanky.//
M1078: No, y-y- //"You take the big one and I'll take the other one."//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: //"You take the big one" or something. [laugh]// Yeah, that was
Gordon.

and she met him down there.
F718: Mmhm.
F1077: Mmhm, he's very English.
F718: There you go. So what was Glasgow like in those days, in the early
seventies, late sixties, early seventies? Or what was that, what was that
club or disco like, what was, what sort of
F1077: Well there was one of these big glitter balls, I remember that.

F718: //In the early seventies? Are they that old? I would have put them as
mid-seventies.//

you'd kind of eye up, deci- deciding which one you//
F718: //Right, right, so you'd fight over the best one.// //I remember
doing that! [laugh]//
F1077: //wanted and you, [laugh] uh-huh.//
M1078: //Pineapple cake or// //Eiffel, Eiffel Tower [?]fine[/?] cake.//
F718: //Fern cake, a fern cake!//

biscuits when she made them.//
F718: //[laugh]// Right. //Is that because, is that because of her Scottish
roots? Or the English thing, or just//

F718: //Uh-huh.//
F1077: //Mm.//
F718: //[cough]//

M1078: Aye, y- yes, smoked. //Dyed, it could have been, mmhm.//
F718: //Smok- yeah right, is that what makes it yellow?//

F718: I don't think I've ever had one.
F1077: Oh, uh-huh. //Well I don't think I ever had them but I didn't think
I liked them.//
F718: //Mm.//
M1078: //There was// there was a business in Glasgow which is still there,
called R. A. McPhees, who were er fishing, fish merchants, //and their
slogan on the vans was R.A.- "Fresh from the sea to R. A. McPhee".//
F718: //Mmhm.//
F1077: //[inaudible]//
F718: Right.
F1077: There's one in Byres Road. //[inaudible]//
F718: //It's Jack McPhee though, is it not?//
F1077: Oh well, it's probably the same family. //Mm, mm, uh-huh//
F718: //Right, cause I was thinking they use that slogan, I think, but

brown skin.//
F718: //[laugh]//
M1078: //skin, and the nutmeg on it, which I didn't like.// //Er,//
F718: //Mmhm, mm.// //Do you like m- nutmeg now?//
M1078: //[inaudible]// //Not greatly, no.//
F718: //Still not? Mm. Didn't think you had a problem with nutmeg.//
//Mm.//
M1078: //Er,// //I probably wouldn't, I probably wouldn't ignore it
altogether if it was there, but//
F718: //Did you know that? [laugh] Yeah.//
M1078: you know, I wouldn't specify nutmeg on my //on my rice pudding//
F718: //Mm, mmhm.//
M1078: particularly. Erm, there was semolina sometimes, which I didn't like
really. And there would be, well my mother never made things like tapioca
and sago
F718: Mmhm.
M1078: puddings,
F718: Mmhm.
M1078: luckily.
F718: Because she didn't like them either? //Mmhm.//
M1078: //Probably, you know, the texture of them she didn't like.// //And
er I certainly never took to those myself.//
F718: //Mm, mmhm.//
M1078: Mm. //Can't think.//
F1077: //I can't remember what sort of thing.//
M1078: Here, erm, I heard something on radio just this morning and it
brought back a memory. E-e- you know how when you buy jelly these days to
make a jelly //dessert, er it's a jelly texture you get?//
F1077: //Yeah, mmhm, tablet, uh-huh.// //It used to be crystals. Mm.//
M1078: //Ah, it used to be jelly crystals.// //I remember my mother got,
used to make jelly//
F1077: //Mm, aye, mm.// //Somebody's found the last tin of Creamola Foam in
the world.//
M1078: //crystals, mm, yes.// //Mmhm.//
F718: //Really?//
F1077: //Uh-huh. Yeah.// //Uh-huh.//
F718: //When did they stop making that?//
M1078: //In a shop.// //[inaudible] Uh-huh, not very long ago.//
F718: //I used to like Creamola Foam. Oh, we had it up to the nineties, I'm
sure.//
F1077: //You used to like it when you were little, uh-huh, so.// //Mmhm.//
M1078: //Yes, uh-huh.// //Aye, it's the, factory stopped it, er it's only
about seven or eight years ago, apparently.//
F718: //I think it's great stuff. Yeah.//
F1077: //Mmhm.// //We used to buy lemonade powder in Woolworth's, you used
to buy it loose, like by the//
M1078: //It's N- Nestlé made it.//
F718: //Uh-huh.//
F1077: //quarter pound or something.// er shovel it in a bag for you. You
ca- I suppose it was sort of Creamola Foam thing, but it was always
lemonade.
F718: Yeah.
F1077: //But er//
M1078: //Mmhm.//
F718: And is it being sold on eBay, this last tin?
F1077: //[inaudible] Mm.//
M1078: //No, er, I think it's going to a museum, isn't it?//
F1077: I can't remember.
M1078: Oh no! Somebody is buying it er to try //and crack the//
F1077: //Oh to analyse it. Mmhm.// //Mm mm.//
F718: //Oh!//
M1078: //the ingredients so that they could start making it again.//
//Mmhm.//
F718: //Yeah.//
M1078: although whether Nestlé'll allow them to do that or not I don't
know, //because they might still have the the rights to it.//
F718: //Mm.// Mmhm.
F1077: Well they could call it something else.
M1078: But er,
F718: Yes. //I don't think you can have a copyright over a brand of
[inaudible]//
F1077: //Mm, no.//
M1078: //Yeah, that's what's going to happen to it.// //Well, you could
have rights to,//
F718: //list of ingredients.//
F1077: //They wouldn't use the Creamola Foam man.//
M1078: //well Coca-Cola say they have.// //No, they would maybe need to//
F1077: //Is it [?]simple[/?] I suppose.//
F718: //Mm. But that's why they keep the ingredients secret presumably so
that you can't copy it.//
M1078: //change the, mmhm, uh-huh.// //Mmhm.//
F718: //Mm because yeah, mmhm.//
F1077: //Mmhm.//
M1078: So, you know, if you can analyse all //the ingredients in Creamola
Foam, presumably you could do it in Coca-Cola.//
F718: //Yeah, yeah.//
F1077: //Mmhm, mmhm.//
F718: //Mmhm.//
M1078: //But, it's not done, apparently,// //if indeed there is a secret
ingredient in it.//
F718: //Mm.// //Well, maybe there isn't, yeah.//
M1078: //Mmhm.//
F718: Mmhm. //Do you y-, sorry. On you go.//
F1077: //[inaudible] No, no. I was going to say, you never stayed to school
lunches, did you?// //School dinners, uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh I did at High
School, they were something else.//
M1078: //No, oh me? No, no, never never once did I have a school lunch.// I
always went home for lunch. Mm.
F718: Did you, do you know what sorts of things people had at school
lunches in those days?
M1078: Erm, er you certainly heard stories of what they //[laugh] Uh-huh,
yeah.//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: //[laugh] Sago and tapioca for you.//
M1078: And er stew. //Erm,//
F718: //[cough]//
F1077: //Yeah.//
M1078: [exhale] I don't know if it was health-gi- healthy or not, well
nothing like burgers. //[inaudible] they didn't exist in those days.//
F718: //No.//
F1077: //Uh-huh.//
M1078: Erm but er th- there was nothing, well cabbage always smelt the
whole school out, //when it was getting boiled up in the canteen, school
canteen.//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: //Mmhm. Cabbage does.//
M1078: Erm, it never smelt very satisfying anyway. //[inaudible]
enticing.//
F718: //No. [laugh]//
F1077: //The worst job was// when you were on dinner duty when you had to
clear the tables and you had to go to the slop bin with everything. //I
remember I dropped the plate in once.//
F718: //Ew!// //[laugh]//
F1077: //And it broke. [laugh] I didn't dare tell anybody.// //[inaudible]
Yeah.//
F718: //Did you just cover it up with some more tapioca and er. [laugh]//
F1077: //urgh//
M1078: //I would have thought every individual would have to take their
own// //plate back to a rack.//
F1077: //No, you had a a sort of monitor system,// //and you were sort of
probably on for a week and you were the one who cleared the table or
something, or the one who brought the mashed potatoes or something.//
M1078: //Yeah. Mmhm.//
F1077: Er, cause it was brought to the table in big bins. And er the best
pudding was fruit and shortbread. //Used to get sort of mixed stewed fruit
which was really quite nice, and//
F718: //Mm! Mmhm.//
F1077: bits of shortbread and that was nice but everything else was
rubbish. //Except we used to get rice pudding with//
F718: //That sounds quite nice.//
F1077: rosehip syrup.
F718: Mm!
F1077: And I liked the rosehip syrup so I used to have a spoonful of that
and that was it, //without the rice pudding.//
F718: //Uh-huh.//
F1077: And Manchester tart, that was, do you have that? //No, it was a kind
of pastry base with a layer of jam and then cold custard on.//
F718: //[inaudible]//
M1078: //No, never heard of it. [cough]//
F718: Ew.
F1077: Yeah. [inaudible] //It probably was, but I just, I expected not to
like sc- school dinners so I tended not to eat them.//
F718: //Probably alright actually, but it sounds a bit odd, custard in a
tart. Yeah.// //What sort of games did you play at school?//
F1077: //Erm.//
F718: At playtimes. //Or was that before games were invented?//
M1078: //Marbles. [sniff]// Or jauries, they were called. Er, mm just tig.
[laugh]
F718: Uh-huh.
M1078: I can't remember. //What else?//
F1077: //I was at primary school when the Hula Hoop first came out.//
F718: Mm.
F1077: //I got a pale green one.//
M1078: //Mm. Girls// girls would have their ropes, //skipping ropes.//
F718: //Mmhm.//
F1077: //Mmhm.// //Mm,//
M1078: //Can't// //remember what else we might have done.//
F1077: //football? No, you wouldn't play football.//
M1078: No, not near all the windows in the school, [laugh] //I didn't.//
F1077: //Just// //stood on corners and talked, [laugh]//
F718: //[laugh]//
M1078: //Er.//
F1077: a lot.
M1078: Mmhm. Even as six year olds? //[laugh] I don't know.//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: //[laugh]//
M1078: Very sophisticated we were. //Er,//
F1077: //Mmhm.// I doubt it.
M1078: Probably remember all this afterwards, when you're away.
//[laugh]//
F718: //Mm. Well we can do it again some time. [laugh]//
M1078: Er.
F1077: I remember when P.E. used to be outside and you got these woven
mats, they were sort of oval mats and you all had to take a mat out and put
it on the playground and sort of lie on it and do exercises and things, as
the weather was dry. //It wasn't comfortable.//
M1078: //No, didn't do that.// If it was warm in the summer, cause we did
have playing fields at our //primary school,//
F718: //Mmhm.//
M1078: er we would be out, //running races and//
F1077: //Mmhm.//
M1078: doing things like that.
F1077: Sports day?
M1078: But we never played anything like football or cricket or hockey, or
anything like that. There was never anything organised
F718: Mmhm.
M1078: by school //for that. No, no.//
F718: //Not even in in P.E. sessions? No. Did you get P.E.?//
M1078: Yes, but then er in those days it was just, you just had one teacher
for the whole year,
F718: Mmhm.
M1078: who taught //academic subjects,//
F718: //Right.//
M1078: practical subjects and P.E. and whatever else. //B- mmhm.//
F718: //This is primary school though?// //Mmhm. Well I think that's that's
true now, is it not?//
F1077: //They weren't, [inaudible], mmhm.//
M1078: //There weren't specialists [?]brought in[/?] for that.// //No,
surely you have a gym teacher and you have a-. Och you must. Well in
secondary school we did.//
F718: //No. I don't, well not in my day, you had the same teacher for
everything.//
F1077: //Mm. Mm. Mm.// //Aye, secondary school, yes, uh-huh.//
F718: //Secondary school, yeah, but that's very different.//
M1078: //Uh-huh. Oh?// //In primary you don't.//
F1077: //Mmhm.//
F718: //I I don't believe it's changed.//
M1078: //I don't know. Don't you get erm// n-n- nomadic teachers? What's
the other //word? Okay.//
F718: //Peripatetic.//
F1077: //Peripatetic. [laugh]// //Uh-huh. Well you do, you do for things
like music. Mmhm.//
F718: //You do for music and stuff. Uh-huh.//
M1078: //pathe- pathetic teachers. [inhale]. Uh-huh. Yes.//
F718: //I don't think you do for things like gym.//
F1077: //No.// //Mm. You'd have to ask Carol.//
M1078: //Don't you? Mm.// //Mmhm.//
F718: //Mm.//
M1078: I can't see Carol er, oh we'd better not tape this! //[laugh]//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: //[laugh]// //[laugh]//
F718: //Don't worry, we won't give her name out properly.//
M1078: //[laugh]//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: //[laugh]//
M1078: Well, she plays badminton with her,
F718: Uh-huh.
M1078: or she takes them for badminton, right enough. //So she teaches
badminton at er primary,//
F718: //Mmhm.//
F1077: //Mm mm.//
F718: //Well there you go. Mmhm.//
M1078: //which seems to be a sort of regular thing.// It's not an
//after-school activity, I don't think.//
F1077: //Oh was it? I thought it was maybe after school.// //Uh-huh,
because I remember her saying today that she'd said to them er "Certain
things I have t-//
M1078: //Mmhm. Mmhm. Exactly.// //Mmhm.//
F1077: //you have// to be here for, but, you know, sort of badminton, if
you don't behave I can throw you out."
F718: Mm.
F1077: //So it must be er a voluntary thing.//
M1078: //Ah but it'll just be throw them out from// you know, "Go and sit
and watch, you're not playing, you're bad."
F1077: No, no no, no I think it was
M1078: Mm.
F1077: er //they were there of their own free will. Mmhm.//
F718: //Mm.//
M1078: //After-school time, hours.// //Oh, I don't know. Mmhm.//
F1077: //Or something at lunchtime maybe.// I had something else, I can't
remember it. Oh yes I remember wh-, my mother used to work in a chocolate
factory in er in Dundee called Lindsay and Rowe. I remember that.
F718: What kind of chocolate did they make?
F1077: I don't know, I just knew it was a chocolate factory. It was
something I kind of grew up knowing. //And she used//
F718: //Mmhm.//
F1077: to say, erm, it kind of put you off chocolate a //bit, though she
did//
F718: //Aye, I was gonna ask yeah.//
F1077: get her taste back for it after she left. //I don't remember being
off it,//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: er mm. Erm, and my grandparents in Monifieth lived in a, the bottom
floor of a tenement in er oh, Well- Wellside Place or something. I can't
just remember the name. //I remember they used to go in a dark close and
there's this//
M1078: //Probably doesn't exist now.//
F1077: it was off to the right, and there was, oh there'd be a tiny wee
sort of kitchen area. //You went through that and you could get out//
F718: //Mmhm.//
F1077: in, there was a a lovely green at the back and the washhouses at the
far end. There was a flower border right up the top of the flats, and a
very old tortoise lived there, //called Toby.//
F718: //Oh!// Mmhm.
F1077: //Used to see him whenever I went. He was reputedly about a hundred
years old but he probably wasn't really.//
M1078: //[pours coffee from cafetière]//

M1078: //Mmhm.//
F1077: seats sort of at the corner, //like little sort of stool things.//
F718: //Yeah.//
F1077: I think it's that you sit on. I can't remember if it had one of
those or not.
F718: Did it have a built-in toilet, er an indoor toilet?
F1077: Erm, probably not. I doubt it but I can't actually //remember
that.//
F718: //Mm.//
F1077: Although I must have used it cause we used to go there for a week o-

kitchen sink.
M1078: Well, you when you were visiting but //what about others?//
F1077: //Yeah.// //Oh I don't know, I don't think anyone.//

M1078: //No, they were, I think they were, well rubber// //rubber tyres on
metal.//
F1077: //Yeah my my first ones had metal wheels I'm// //sure, and they made
a heck of a racket when you went down the street on them.//
F718: //Uh-huh.//
M1078: //They were certainly all all shiny metal// frame, //with a leather
strap.//
F718: //Uh-huh, uh-huh.//
F1077: //Mm mm.// //with th- that nut underneath that you used to adjust
the length on them.//
F718: //Mm.//
M1078: //But er, mmhm.//

them.//
F1077: //Mm. [laugh] Yeah.//

something? No, there was something wrong with it, was it was it wonky wheel
or something, but you could get new
F718: Right. //Uh-huh.//

M1078: //There was nobody quite like it.//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: //[laugh]//
F718: //[laugh]//
M1078: //Is this "get at Jim" night?// //Is this what it's all about?//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: //No, [laugh], you did.// You did. We were talking about it last

and we went to stay in it.//
F718: //So you stayed with them? Uh-huh.//

something, they were away.//
F718: //Oh right, I see, right.//
F1077: //Mmhm.// You used to go up the North East as well, didn't you? //I

holiday, it was a disaster but er//
F1077: //oh, oh, I thought, oh I thought you went up with them as well.//
F718: //It was a disaster? Why?//
M1078: //No. Uh-huh. Well,// normally we went to Arbroath,

F718: //Mmhm.//
M1078: when I was young. Er, no A- Aberdeen was a disaster because [laugh]

M1078: er wa- was stealing from my mother's purse, [laugh] which was left
in //the bedroom//
F718: //Oops.//
F1077: //Hm!//
M1078: and the police were involved and all that sort of thing. Er it
rather tainted our view of Aberdeen. [laugh]
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: //[laugh]//
F718: I dare say it's not all like that. [laugh]
M1078: No, maybe not, but er, you know, something happens like //that,//
F718: //Yeah.//
F1077: //Mm.//
M1078: you have a a bad impression of the whole place.
F718: Mm.
M1078: Besides, I don't remember the weather being particularly good, and
it was just a big city after all, it wasn't really a holiday place,
//although it had the//
F718: //Mm mmhm.//
F1077: //There's a beach.//
M1078: //the Beach Ballroom, and, which well which wasn't in a//

F718: //Is it still a ballroom or is it like a club now? Mmhm.//
M1078: a club but it was, you know, famous, always been famous as //the
Beach Ba- Ballroom.//
F718: //Mmhm.// Mm.
M1078: Mmhm, no my mother and father
F718: Mm.

M1078: //toured around there from where they were based.// //Pit- New
Pitsligo.//
F718: //Mmhm.// //Oh yeah.//
F1077: //[inaudible] you'd been there.//
M1078: //That's where they stayed.//
F718: //Yeah, I di- [laugh].//
F1077: //Mmhm.//
F718: //Is that near Peterhead, isn't it, up a bit?//
M1078: //Mmhm [inhale]// //Well it's inland quite a bit from there,

M1078: Up in that area, //the North East.//
F718: //Mmhm. Buchan.//
F1077: //[inaudible]//
M1078: //Mm.//
F1077: But you used to get your meals included, didn't you, alth- it was a
boarding house, and you used to get all your meals.
M1078: Well you had either er full-board or half-board.
F718: Mmhm.
M1078: Or you had attendance, in the sort of early years after the war.
[laugh]
F718: What do you mean by 'attendance'?
M1078: Erm, the landlady cooked your own food for you. //I suppose it w-
was down to rationing.//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: //[laugh]//
F718: //Right yeah.//
M1078: //And// landladies couldn't go out and buy //what they needed for//
F718: //Yeah.// //Uh-huh.//
M1078: //all their boarders.// So er you took your own coupons. You got,
well //you either got//
F718: //Right.//
M1078: your own food and brought it in or you gave the coupons to the
landlady and she went //and registered them at//
F718: //Uh-huh.//
M1078: her own //butcher and grocer and whoever.//
F718: //Uh-huh.//
M1078: And er, so in effect it was your food, //and she just made it for
you.//
F718: //Yeah. Mm.// //Bizarre. [laugh]//
F1077: //Mmhm.//
F718: //I didn't know that.//
M1078: //But// er aye well that was because of the War, //pa- post-War er
the post-War years and rationing still being a feature.//
F718: //Yeah. Mmhm.// Did you holiday much in Scotland when you were young,
before you moved up here? //Well Dundee, [inaudible] mmhm.//
F1077: //Well, yes, in that relatives, uh-huh, er Monifieth was the the
usual place.//
F718: Mmhm.
F1077: Er used to come up, usually just with my mum, er my dad would be
working, //bu-//
F718: //Mmhm.//
F1077: apart from that the first holiday I remember was in Redcar in a
caravan, er I think it rained //all week.//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: And er I remember buying a little, Sheila, that's my sister, and I
were there, and we bought little ornaments and one was a little sort of
woman with a barrel beside her you kept matches in. And the other w- had a
little sort of apron on and it changed colour, blue when it was going to
rain and pink when it was going to be dry or something. And I remember they
used to be in the the sort of display cupboard bit at home, //and I broke
one of them one day//
F718: //Mmhm.//
F1077: and I remember I I hid the bits in the sugar bowl [laugh] and I
hoped they would //never be found, and eventually they were.//
F718: //[laugh]// //[laugh]//
F1077: //[laugh]// //I was kind of hoping nobody would ever use the//
F718: //[laugh]// //[laugh]//
F1077: //sugar, and they wouldn't miss them. Er,// didn't know anything
about it when they were found. //[laugh]//
F718: //[laugh]// I take it you didn't get away with it? //[laugh] Yeah.//
F1077: //No, I think they suspected me.// //Mm. And apart from that we used
to go to Whitby.//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: Erm cause a a mate of my dad's at work had a caravan and he used to
to drive us through to the caravan site there.
F718: Mmhm.
F1077: Or we'd go to Scarborough because there was cricket there and my dad
liked the cricket. [laugh]
F718: To play, or just to watch? //Mm [sniff]//
F1077: //No, no, no he just watched.//
F718: Mmhm.
F1077: Er but Monifieth was sort of the the place I came to mu- most
often.
F718: Mmhm. //Was there much there really?//
F1077: //No-// //No, [laugh] erm//
F718: //[laugh] Is there much there now? [laugh]//
M1078: //[laugh]//
F1077: the- there's probably more now. //Well//
F718: //Mmhm.//
F1077: certainly more houses. //But//
F718: //Mmhm.//
F1077: y- you just some of came and sort of visited relatives and //and
went to the beach,//
F718: //Mmhm.//
F1077: played all on the beach and er I remember visiting my cousin. She
was in the school, on the main s-, on the high street in Monifieth and we
went along one day at playtime and spoke through the railings to her, like
being at the zoo. //Er,//
F718: //[laugh] Yeah.//
F1077: I do- I don't remember there being anything on the beach except you
used to collect shells.
F718: Uh-huh.
F1077: And er further along, you would only be able to go so far along
because it was Barry Budden, which was, was that an Army //camp or
something?//
M1078: //Uh-huh, it was a camp.//
F718: //Mm.//
F1077: //And then the other way was// Broughty Ferry which was where my mum
and dad had met because my dad was stationed there, //erm er in the
Army,//
F718: //Right.//
F1077: so they met through that.
F718: Mm. //Shall we stop there?//
M1078: //And//
F718: //Are you, d- about to say something? Carry on if//
F1077: //Mmhm mmhm, that's probably//
F718: //you, you do.//
M1078: //I was gonna ask// mother a question. //Er,//
F1077: //Mmhm.//
M1078: er how long was he there in the Army, cause he was abroad as well,
wasn't he?
F718: //Mm.//
F1077: //Oh yes, he was abroad// during the War. //Uh-huh. He joined the
Army early.//
M1078: //Sudan. [laugh] [inaudible]//
F1077: He gave a false birthday, so he always reckoned he had two birthdays
like the Queen. //Erm, I can't remember what age//
F718: //[laugh] And Paddington.//
F1077: he was when he joined but I've got his papers and things upstairs
somewhere. Erm, he was in, he must have been stationed up there before he
was sent abroad. //Erm,//
F718: //Why Broughty Ferry?//
M1078: //Mmhm or before.//
F718: //Just cause it's sort of out of the way and [inaudible]//
F1077: //th-// //I suppose it was popular as a training place. Mmhm.//
F718: //relatively unpopulated. Mm.//
M1078: //I suppose Dundee was an ind-, heavy industry in Dundee maybe they
were//
F718: Right.
F1077: //And in fact, well my mum lived there after Sheila was born in
nineteen thirty-nine.//
M1078: //[inaudible]//
F1077: And my dad er must have gone abroad then or shortly after then.
F718: //Mmhm.//
M1078: //Mm.//
F1077: Erm I can't remember if he was abroad when she was born. I don't
think so. And my mum lived with her parents in er Monifieth //for a
while.//
F718: //Mmhm.//
F1077: //And then when they moved south, erm, Sheila can remember they
lived with my my gran, that's my dad's mother, in Stockton,//
M1078: //[throat]//
F1077: cause she remembers it, it was a a dark house and she was scared
going upstairs cause it was dark and everything, she didn't like it there.
Erm and then by the time I was born we'd moved to Norton, cause I was eight
years younger.
F718: Yep.
F1077: Still am.
F718: Yep. [laugh]
M1078: Baby boomer.
F1077: Mm?
M1078: A baby boomer.
F1077: Well no, it was really the year before, cause the year above us at
school had an extra stream in it because there was //so many.//
M1078: //Mm.//
F1077: It was really
M1078: I thought from forty-six onwards. //Baby boom time.//
F1077: //Well, mm.// Yeah, but //well uh-huh.//
M1078: //Building up to it.//
F718: //[laugh]//
F1077: //It must have slackened off a bit after the first boom. [laugh]//
F718: [laugh]
F1077: Uh-huh. But we used to have lots of sort of postcards and things
that my dad sent, and photographs he sent sent home. //Mm.//
M1078: //Where in particular was he abroad,// //if you remember?//
F1077: //He was in India.//
M1078: Mmhm.
F1077: Erm and I'm sure he was in Africa as //well.//
M1078: //Mmhm.//
F1077: But India, erm I remember and //er I remember pictures of him with a
horse.//
M1078: //Well [inaudible].//
F1077: And he was a gunner. Pictures of him standing beside his big gun, he
had a sort of
M1078: Mmhm. //Does it//
F1077: //like cannon thing.// //Mmhm.//
F718: //Mmhm.//
M1078: //tell you on the medals you've got,// //which campaigns they
were?//
F1077: //It will do. Uh-huh, I'm sure it will, uh-huh.// But he was
certainly in India, cause I remember hearing about it. Mm, aye. And then he
n- he didn't want to travel after that. He said he'd travelled enough
during the War so he was never interested in going, anywhere. [laugh]
F718: Okay? //Will we stop there? Okay.//
F1077: //Mmhm, mmhm.//
